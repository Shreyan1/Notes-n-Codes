nsince wa unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film there is no way to know how accurate the film is but suspect that much of it only came from whale inner fantasy and hallucination nwhale who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror picture decided fifteen year before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once homosexual scandal broke out involving him na the film tell it during the end of his life whale at his large home in a became infatuated with the tall handsome and much younger man clayton boone brendan fraser who wa working a the gardener at his home njames whale we learn quickly wa what many people refer to him a in the film dirty old man nin one of the opening scene young film enthusiast visit whale home to interview him and whale agrees on one condition for every question he answer the young man must take off an article of clothing nbecause of this episode we know exactly what it is whale want when he asks clayton to pose for him for painting later making the excuse that his bright white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off nclayon agrees and doesn really think much of this much to the warning of his friend becoming more and more intrigued in the story whale tell him about his past ncertainly the relationship between whale and boone is headed for downfall since whale start to grow deep love for this young man even though boone is not gay and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life a he begin to seldom suffer mild stroke and moment of true catharsis god and monster is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of director who wa forced to become somewhat of an outcast due to his sexual preference and never got the recognition he would have liked since he longed to be referred to a motion picture director rather than horror director nand in one heartbreaking scene he attends party with boone being his guest held by director george cuckor and find that many of the other attendee do not recognize him anymore nit is evident that whale first love in his life wa making movie and when his career ultimately fell apart so did his passion in life na played brilliantly by ian mckellen james whale come off a sad but dignified man and person who wa not afraid to stand out from others just a long a he knew he wa being true to himself nhe never hid the fact that he wa gay however even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession and it wa this unblinking honesty that made him great person nthrough the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone boone of course only thing of whale a possible friend or someone he can talk to while it mean so much more to whale who see boone a sort of his salvation in life nalthough boone is only in dead end job a gardener of people home whale view him a the ideal man not only one that is good looking even though it is this attraction that first begin his feeling but one that will actually listen to him nsince whale life with only his loyal but disapproving maid touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor nalthough an extremely fine and mature picture few small element hold the film back from ultimate greatness nit is appreciated that the film doe not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story development but it is little thin and the structuring of the on again off again friendship at the film center is fairly predictable nwe know early on where these two character are headed and we can guess that there will be final confrontation between the two a the tension slowly build nin lesser hand this set up might have felt too calculated but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that help the film to be much more than this nalso subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and waitress working at bar effectively played by lolita davidovich but abruptly dropped and never brought up again nif the film wa not going to follow up on this side story then it perhaps should have been taken out altogether god and monster is heartfelt and intelligent motion picture impressively directed by bill condon who sense relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone

doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably nit is sad testament when person true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them based on the

go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy nmy colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if le is more then the blair witch filmmaker must have thought that nothing is more nand this worked for him nwell m sorry but nothing ni nothing nnothing is not more nit nothiiiiiinggggggggggg ni do not pay 5 dollar to see nothing nothing is free available all around the world at location near you ni am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary ni could just discount them and say well guess they are just pansy chicken shit who are probably scared of their own shadow nbut have intelligent friend who like this movie and so that doesn hold water nthere must be some other reason then again maybe my first thought is correct think ll try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction nwhen hear people praising this film never hear them talking about what make up about 97 of this movie three kid bickering with each other about being lost nthey only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minute of screen time nthis being few very short night scene where the kid hear some unscary sound and another where they shout josh nover and over nthis film should not be called the blair witch project it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmaker get lost nand argue with each other noh lady and gentleman you will be so scared when you hear them shouting josh nand if you thought that wa scary wait till you see pile of rock and then some tinkertoy lincoln log oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pant with fear noh yeah and some goo on one of their backpack nyou ve never seen terror like this folk and you don want to nthe chevy chase goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film for current film highly recommend the sixth sense or stir of echo for creepy filmgoing experience nthis film is an example of marketing with no substance nthe marketing wa brilliant and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film nthey want this film to be good nand think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they don have anything else to praise nthat wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along but this is not it nthis film could have been so much better njust think if maybe there had been only 10 minute of arguing about being lost and 80 minute of nighttime stuff ni saw this movie with girl who wa extremely pumped for it nshe wa sold on this film nand then at one point during it she turned to me and asked are nwe supposed to be scared by this ni ve heard one opinion that you have to use your imagination to create the fear in this movie nwell thought that wa what the filmmaker were supposed to do nuse their imagination and create good movie ni mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay 5 buck for it nbut even if you like this idea then what are you imagining nan entity called the blair witch nsome redneck fucking with these kid nare either of these thing really scary when you think about it ni ve heard several people say that this movie make them recall how scary it can be to be out in the wood and hear something nwell sure thats scary in real life but there are lot of thing that are scary in real life that are not scary in movie nor even interesting nyou could sit in your house and see snake or spider and it could be scary but in film it wouldn be nand no movie doe not need big budget or cgi special effect to be scary or creepy nactually the le the better see the equally awful remake of the haunting nbut you have to do something nyou cant just count on u all having nostalgic memory of how something like this could be scary if it were real nand by the way about the shakycam filming in blair witch naren these supposed to be filmmaker who should know how to point camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly ni not even talking about the couple scene where they are terrified that justified ni talking about the other 87 minute of the movie where they can seem to shoot anything smoothly at all nminor quibble there nthere is feeling in me that the people that like this movie are sucker nthat the filmmaker are just laughing their ass off all the way to the bank nand think there is good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves what wa thinking nbut if they don then thats fine nif it work for them then that okay guess ni just lament that by making this movie hit we are going to be subjected to more of the nothing is more approach npretty soon we re going to get some movie like this just still shot of prison jail cell nfor 90 minute nand we ll have to use our imagination and think to ourselves my god wouldn it be scary to spend life in prison nthis movie is the scariest movie of all time nor shot of coffin with some funeral director arguing with each other man do you know how

in california nwe laughed our head off a we shared the wild and crazy mishap the family endured ntwo year later we watched again a they went to europe and four year after that we shared christmas with them nnow eight more year have passed and the laugh have done more than die nthey ve been cremated nvegas vacation brings back chevy chase a clark griswold the good intentioned but ill fated father of two nthe premise is basically the same nclark ha wonderful idea to take his family on bonding vacation this time to la vega nhis wife ellen beverly angelo and teenage kid rusty and audrey always played by different actor this time around by ethan embry and marisol nichols respectively join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casino will make the backdrop for ninety minute of slapstick nof course vacation movie wouldn be complete without good ole eddie reprised by randy quaid the misfit cousin showing up at all the wrong time nthere isn too much of plot here when it come right down to it nit really just skit movie nthere are couple of way to define skit movie which is not real term a far a know nthe first would be movie that basically ha one running gag for two hour therefore coming off like two hour skit nthe second would be movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skit each lasting about five minute nvegas vacation come off like the first na good example of the latter would be last year black sheep nthe problem with this format is that it becomes old fast and it doesn really fit into movie mold nin these case plot which is generally very thin is used either a shameless filler between scene or to simply add convenience to the gag e nhave good vega joke make vega movie nsuch is the case with this movie mini plot nclark get gambling fever and begin spending all of the griswold money ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton rusty ha fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage and audrey is desperate for fun and wind up joining her cousin vickie shae lyn a an exotic dancer nthe simple fact is this movie isn funny nat first did find myself chuckling heartily at couple of little joke but when the movie got rolling my interest suddenly stopped nchase play clark griswold really well nhe made the character and he is the character nd angelo to be quite honest never wa too impressive a ellen and this movie doesn show any sign of redemption na for the two new griswold kid the word blah come to mind nthe vacation series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two character the simple reason being that there is nothing to them nthey re so generic you ll expect the credit to read girl 1 a audrey griswold nvegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor nyes it true that vega vacation isn even close to being close to being a funny a the others which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy way but there are couple of other thing that set this one negatively apart nfirst off why did they leave off the national lampoon heading on the title ni couldn find any reason why but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn want to be associated with such lame film nthat saying lot especially when you look at what else the company ha proudly presented loaded weapon 1 pcu etc if they expected this to be another hit you would assume they be proud to tack on the notorious header but for reason only we can guess at like the movie sucking they didn nthere is another difference here that make an obvious impact nthe first three film in the vacation series were written by john hughes talented writer who is behind several popular film of the 80 including mr nmom sixteen candle the breakfast club weird science pretty in pink ferris bueller day off plane train and automobile and uncle buck nwowzers nwhat r sum nlooking at the name you think this guy wrote everything that now stand a movie icon for the 1980 nwell that not all nthis guy also brought u 90 hit including the home alone series the remake of 101 dalmatian dennis the menace and the current flubber nvegas vacation however didn have john hughes behind it and the loss is very obvious nthis time around the script is in the hand of elisa bell whose only credit thus far include four made for tv movie nvegas vacation play very much like one and it would actually work much better a made for tv sequel nif this sound like wild idea it not nrevenge of the nerd third and fourth installment were both television movie and they seemed like it nvegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network a 2 00 m nsunday morning movie but a silver screen major motion picture it quite out of place nstephen kessler jejune direction doesn help thing either nhe only make the film even more tv movie ish neach consecutive vacation movie ha suffered drop in directing power nwe started the series off with harold ramis who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day a well a co writing ghostbusters nnot too bad nthen we had national lampoon european vacation being directed by amy heckerling who would go on to direct the hit look who talking and clueless a well a having already directed the infamous fast time at ridgemont high nlastly we had national lampoon christmas vacation directed by jeremiah chechik who went on to direct the charming benny joon nkessler so far ha one title under his belt the short film birch street gym which received an oscar nomination in 1992 ngranted that this wa his first attempt at feature length film we can allow for some amateurish quality but instead we get

       " 'on re watching italian writer director dario argento much lauded murder mystery tenebrae wa struck more than anything else by how many sin he commits a storyteller and manages to get away with nin emphasising style over matter of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circle but some aficionado still praise tenebrae a the greatest of his giallo murder mystery nwhile it certainly not perfect repeated viewing reveal it to be nonetheless densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller nthe story follows promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal anthony franciosa where he discovers that serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book tenebrae nwith the police on his back for lead he decides to take personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into mystery where all is not a it seems nthe film benefit enormously from fine central performance by franciosa nhe brings grace charm and deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the book he writes and the unfolding real life horror around him nthe film is awash with fascinating psychosexual tension nargento peel back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyle to reveal an amoral ambivalent shadowy world where desire in all it form ha become dangerous business ntenebrae is perhaps the most multi layered of argento script to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here nit may take at least two or three viewing to appreciate all the psychological theme at play nin that respect it strongly recall his previous giallo deep red profondo rosso the full length italian language version and fan will enjoy spotting the recurring theme nneedless to say for argento fan there is no denying the director brilliance a stylist nmany of the action and murder sequence are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork nthey are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scene with light rather than the dark shadow and deep rich colour of earlier work like deep red and suspiria ninstead tenebrae set design and lighting paint sleek clinical chilly vision of vaguely futuristic urban world nand the soundtrack mix of electronic atmosphere and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborator goblin is the perfect accompaniment nso tenebrae ha much to recommend it no question nstill constantly nagging at the back of this viewer mind is several lump in the narrative nsome critic argue that logic doesn matter in argento film but damnit it matter in all film to the point where viewer don deserve to feel cheated nby the way if you don want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraph nabout an hour into tenebrae the story take an unexpected twist which properly handled could have proved ingenious nwe witness the murder of the serial killer himself by man who we later discover is none other than the author peter neal nhe is insane apparently nthe murder then continue for the remainder of the film a neal decides it time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife nhe is finally revealed to u a this second killer in the film bloody climax nbut argento muff the twist both technically and narratively nyou see we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who wa crouching in the bush nearby the whole time and spying on the killer house nbut thanks to poor editing it had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway nbad cutting put the timing way out nin other word he almost in two place at once nduring this crucial scene we are also thrown ridiculous red herring nby the film end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self inflicted nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he wa attacked by fleeing assailant nthe injury nhe banged himself on the head with bloody great rock nthus the revelation of the hero a killer and anti hero in the final scene may still prove shocking but it all somewhat implausible by the time the end credit have rolled nhelpfully in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashback of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along nbut there too is problem a the explanation offered for his motivation are psychologically fuzzy to say the least nthe story owes u better understanding of franciosa mind his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage ntenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistency nfor instance teenage boy and girl leave hotel room and minute later we see the girl riding off on the back of motorbike nwe would assume the rider is the same boy but it turn out to be some male character we aren even introduced too nthat careless filmmaking pure and simple nwhy you may ask do go on about the story flaw nbecause when it come to visuals and set piece argento is one of the most exciting filmmaker in the world ntake one of the extended scene in tenebrae nan upset girl wandering the street at night needlessly taunt guard dog to the point where almost unbelievably it jump high fence and chase her across town nfinally a she desperately seek escape from this crazed canine she accidentally stumble on the serial killer lair nit an absolutely masterful sequence tense and exciting and communicating wealth of information through visuals alone nand that exactly the kind of thing that make the flaw so frustrating ntoo often it seems argento film a whole are le than the sum of their impressive part nmind you if you love murder mystery then tenebrae is still worth look nand if you re fan of argento unique style of giallo thriller then it essential nsee the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli nit a stylish great looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative na shame because it doesn have to be that way ntake argento more recent stendhal syndrome 1992 where with the aid of co writer franco ferrini he fashioned solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache nproof that he can do it if he try',\n",

a he did in that one he had just won an oscar carlito way wa destined for underrated heaven nthat what it is an underrated gem of movie nand what shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing job with it and turn it into great piece of pulpy character study carlito way deal with well carlito brigante pacino puerto rican ex drug kingpin who get out of long jailterm when his coke addicted curly haired lawyer sean penn point out legal technicality nof course carlito wa actually awoken in prison and ha decided to go straight even if he really crook at heart ncarlito like barry lyndon is man who is trapped by fate at every turn and can escape into something he is not ncarlito attempt at clean legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn nwhen he first get out friend of his end up leading him into big shoot out where he ha to kill couple people to survive nhe constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he doing anything illegal and his lawyer find himself neck deep in pile of shit needing him to try and help him out which includes him doing some prison breaking ncarlito like ratso rizzo want to go to miami since according to film logic that where it at but need some funding nbeing legend he is quickly able to get nice job running big dance club this is the 70 by the way and since some of this take place in night club we get to hear all sort of 70 classic including several c nand the sunshine band tune my personal favorite nhe get bodyguard the great luis guzman at his best and is soon running pretty good business even if he constantly attracting underworld young thug like benny blanco from the bronx john leguiziamo who is more than once pointed out to be young version of carlito non the other side the symbol of promise and hope is gail penelope ann miller what happened to her his girlfriend from before prison nshe a goregeous ballerina and stripper and soon carlito is trying to get back with her and take her with him when he finally leaf for miami nwhile this relationship is never fully defined or anything we get sense of love between them and they have some truly interesting scene between them she never give him address or locale he always ha to track her down nall of these element clash together at the end in brilliantly executed emotional climax which is inevitable nwhen say inevitable mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack putting great spin on it nsure it going to eleveate some of the tension but it give the film lot of depth a carlito is seen trapped by fate nwhat amazing is the big chase sequence amazingly done by de palma ha lot of tension and thrill nlike apollo 13 we know what going to happen but we re still thrilled by what happens in the middle nit also very emotional thanks to great script by david koepp and amazing performance by pacino and miller nde palma is famous or infamous for lot of violence in his film nhis earlier flim scarface which starred pacino in the lead ha ton of it especially at the end and nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which m still not over nbut de palma actually reign in more quieter scene nto me the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of building looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet nthis is the most brilliantly done and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film and probably the best in de palma film history nwith gorgeous soprano duet in the background and rain pouring down onto trashcan lid covering carlito head and saddened remorseful look on pacino face it a tear jerker well for me dunno about you nthe acting from all is great especially from the three lead npacino wa panned for his performance chiefly because his accent wasn puerto rican enough and well it wasn a strong a his oscar winning role in scent of woman nwell his scent of woman performance wa great and all but it wa nothing really but a comic kevin pollack said foghorn leghorn impression nin carlito way he emotional and strong despite the fact that he remorseful over his entire lifestyle which he cannot change ni felt more for carlito brigante than did for the tango dancing insult throwing blind guy in scent of woman na said penelope ann miller is great and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry nand they re scene are well written with some good clever dialogue which add some interest to an otherwise bland relationship nand sean penn is amazing a the coke addicted rat attorney nevery scene he in he ha great energy and even measure up to the greatness that is pacino nin smaller role john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great carlito way is one of those film which you heard about briefly but when you finally watch it you re absolutely blown away nit a wonderful film highly underrated little

       " 'mandingo ha traditionally been seen a one of two thing either much needed revisionist look at slavery in the south or in the word of film critic leonard maltin trashy potboiler that appeal only to the m crowd nactually think mandingo is strange combination of the two although it fails on both front nit too trashy to be good drama but too dramatic to be good trash nthe story take place on dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell james mason and his son hammond perry king none day in new orleans hammond come across slave trader selling mandingo named mede heavyweight boxer ken norton nalthough the movie never explains it mandingo is simply the name for african who come from the region of the upper niger river valley naccording to the movie mandingos were the roll royce of african slave nhammond pay top price for mede and ha to fight off others in order to get him nhammond then spends his time training mede to be fighter in money brawl with other slave nmeanwhile hammond ha married his cousin blanche susan george because she want to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce grandchild nhammond however is happier spending night with his bed wench the derogatory name given to female slave used by their master for easy sex nit is quickly apparent that hammond despite his overt racism is more in love with his bed wench sensitive slave girl named ellen brenda sykes than he is with blanche nhammond considers blanche tainted good because he find out on their wedding night that another man had pleasured her before he did nof course it fine that he slept with numerous slave girl but the fact that his wife white lady had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her nso blanche is usually left lonely and sex starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen nblanche get back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child nhammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche ha given birth to half black child although it okay that ellen wa pregnant by hammond so warren kill the child by letting it bleed to death after birth and hammond poison blanche nhammond then find mede shoot him twice in the shoulder and push him into giant cauldron of boiling water nyes you read right the film end with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive njudging only by the plot mandingo is pure sexploitation nthe main purpose of the film seems to be getting a many black and white into bed together a possible with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society nwhen mandingo wa released in 1975 it wa still bit of shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such graphic detail this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audience of curious voyeur ndramatically mandingo is weak and unfocused and historically it mostly confused nif one were to judge history by this film it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery wa based on sexuality not economics nnot once in the film do we see any of the slave working except for few house servant nthe men spend most of the time sitting around while the sole purpose of female slave seems to be free sex for the owner nthere is historical basis in the notion that slave owner often slept with their female slave but mandingo overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery give the movie the unpleasant taste of cheap sex flick although there plenty of violence fight vicious beating shooting and the aforementioned human boiling sequence thrown in for good measure nsome tried to write off mandingo a blaxploitation film one of number of quickly made low budget film appealing to black sensibility in the early seventy but it not that easy mandingo wa studio financed by paramount picture and produced by dino de laurentiis the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious production a the bible 1966 the remake of king kong 1976 and the ill fated dune 1984 nthe director wa richard fleischer veteran who wa best known for several special effect laden action movie including 20 000 league under the sea 1954 and fantastic voyage 1966 a well a such superior suspense film a the narrow margin 1952 nthe script based on the supermarket best seller by ken ostott and the subsequent play by jack kirkland wa penned by norman wexler who had been nominated for an oscar two year earlier for his work on serpico njames mason perry king and susan george were well known and respected actor mason already had three oscar nomination under his belt and ken norton appeared to have promising film career nso why is mandingo so bad na number of reason including the fact that all those experienced filmmaker behind and in front of the camera did lousy job nwexler script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive it combine stereotyped slave talk yessuh massuh stereotyped southern white trash talk fer whut re you gittin outta bed and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk if you see me hang you gonna know you killed black brother nfleischer direction is clumsy especially during the fight scene and all the actor give weak performance especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable nnevertheless credit should be given where credit is due ndespite it exploitative nature mandingo wa one of the first hollywood movie to take an alternative look at slavery nuntil then there had been kind of underlying racism in all hollywood film dealing with slavery neven classic such a gone with the wind 1939 can be seen a inherently racist by it glossing over the subject matter mandingo reassessed the south and showed that it wasn all beautiful plantation green field and pretty sunset nbut all this is constantly undermined by the film negligible point of view it claim to see thing from the black perspective but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tale of the white owner nwith little more maturity and different handling mandingo might have been an effective worthwhile film nwhile it portrays many sensitive aspect of slavery it never deal with them nthe issue the movie brings up are worthwhile but wexler script refuse to move them beyond surface level of trashily vicarious viewing nthere is great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of sexual relationship between slave and owner but mandingo never doe it nsteven spielberg touched on that same topic in schindler list 1993 by looking at nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feeling for jewish maid nthe difference between that film and mandingo is that spielberg dealt with the situation in fair unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma mandingo is satisfied to simply show some skin and because of that it trashy potboiler nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished',\n",

wouldn bother me if stigma had story or character that were remotely engaging nthough wainwright vanity certainly doesn help he doe seem to have been given nearly unworkable script nwhere are plot continuity and character development when you need them ncase in point frankie page is the character that assume we are supposed to identify and sympathize with but we aren given any back story on her character or any reason to like her nthe extent of her character development seems to be that she is hard working hairdresser who can somehow afford cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building and she kind of cute so let start the bleeding nthe fact that she clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn help either naccording to frankie page what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wound on your wrist and back ngo clubbing nsure that make sense narquette byrne and pryce give it the old college try but their character are so one dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking nscenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reach the point of becoming laughable neven though frankie page life is falling apart before her very eye she still find the time to hit on priest who wanders in to her hair salon neven more curiously he seems to be interested in her advance nfather andrew religious doubt pop up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic na for pryce he may a well wear curled mustache and cackle ll get you my pretty for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded ntrust me m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turn out to be villain nwhat worse after being faced with dull character and the prospect of having annoying camera trick and loud music jammed down our throat we now have to contend with story that start off in one direction veers off in another then another and end up being totally incomprehensible nfirst of all the film doesn even bother to explain what should be very simple plot detail how doe frankie get the stigma merely by touching rosary nhow come an atheist like her wa chosen since father andrew mention that only very devout believer have ever received stigma nactually m not sure what frankie wa posessed by nsupposedly stigma occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit but the film later ha her being posessed by the dead priest and later by some evil spirit think nwhich one is it nthe answer to this question of course is very simple the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effect and flashy camera work mr wainwright want to use this time nfurthermore the ending is ridiculously neat little wrap up and the filmmaker compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into diatribe against the catholic church nif you do any research at all about the gospel of st thomas you ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church a the film seems to claim but that it is readily available at your local library nthere nothing the catholic need to worry about though stigma religion is so off base that it can be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church nif they wanted to portray catholic priest a mobster they should have gone all out and equipped them with sharkskin suit and tommy gun which would have been far more interesting ni not catholic in fact don care much for the catholic church but it cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any mean nit rare to see film that fails on a many level a stigma doe nit not thought provoking though it would like to be and it is definitely not scary though it pretend to be ni not sure why they tried to pas this off a horror film because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story nmaybe it an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scene have any dramatic weight whatsoever nthe initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over and over and over nlike so many film of the mtv generation this one suffers from overkill nso much is overdone in stigma that it eventually ha no effect on the audience leaving u to pick out the film many flaw ni also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st thomas is so earth shattering nwhen we finally hear it the saying sound like something every five year old learns on their first day of sunday school which mean that for all it flash the whole film is really much ado about nothing nthe dog day of summer usually produce one monstrous dog and stigma is it',\n",

believable dialogue sample from reindeer game rule 1 never put car thief behind the wheel create multi faceted character or even engineer coherent plot but he sure know how to pile on numerous nonsensical twist and turn no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely nhis screenplay for reindeer game turn the table on the audience so many time that watching the film becomes something of punishment with no reward anywhere in sight ni can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard oh you thought my movie wa gonna go here ck you jack as take that twist decipher this mother cker nit almost a if the writer were angry at u for shelling out money to see his stupid movie nand why the hell would anyone want to invest time in movie when the screenwriter keep changing his own rule for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is nauteur theory be damned it kruger style not the director that wind up on screen nkruger ha obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut sometimes le is more nand his numerous twist can even claim to be original arlington rd ending is direct steal from the much better alan pakula thriller the parallax view and in reindeer game we get this ol gem character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn know pronoun used to protect the gender of the character grammar nbe damned how did you know that nthe stunned protagonist asks suddenly realizing that the character wa in on the whole thing all along n nsince twist ending are currently so in vogue and seeing a how kruger screenplay usually come equipped with about three twist per ending guess it no wonder why he work so frequently nhe quickly becoming miramax mickey mouse the company ha already signed him to work on several of their upcoming project nthis is appropriate considering that miramax which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring film ha quickly become grindhouse for coddling foreign import life is beautiful and freddie prinze jr vehicle ntheir company current logo could be we ride the trend nreindeer game star ben affleck a rudy supposedly hardened criminal spending his day and night behind bar with fantasy of pecan pie dancing atop his head nalthough affleck is given some barbed wire tattoo to insinuate bad assness he play the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through police academy flick naffleck is such puppy dog that it impossible to believe he could survive in harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone bitch nthe role itself is so badly written the character only grows ball when the plot call for it the twist so outrageous and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about a close to self parody a can recall recent serious movie getting nit may have been wiser had the film maker simply went all the way in that direction casting jerry seinfeld a the hardened criminal and howard stern a the sniveling bad guy who played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance njames frain is nick rudy cellmate manslaughterer who found pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason charlize theron nashley is prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photo of her though she never seen one picture of him nwhich work out fine since the character is killed in near riot and rudy who wa to be paroled on the same day a nick take his place which lead to sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy so frenzied it kinda look like rape and surprise visit from ashley brother gabriel gary sinise who waltz into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co horts nhe plan to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he think is nick who according to what he wrote in the letter to ashley used to work a guard in the indian casino nthough by the end the film pull the rug out from under u so frequently that everything ve described might a well be irrelevant nthis is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on several scene in which after catching his prey the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy ha chance to kill his captor and crack stupid one liner nincluded two 2 scene of two 2 different bad guy explaining their motif to the hero when they should be killing him one following the other no le nthough it an action film the ending is more talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to u by one flustered character actor after another while affleck look on incredulous a the audience nthe flick wa directed by john frankenheimer straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career fell off the list following string of flop and now in his old age is slowly climbing his way back up nit would be success story if he were choosing better script but his last major film wa ronin one of those almost but not quite movie which followed the island of dr morneau you remember the one with marlon brando in mime make up and not so flattering moo moo and now this nhe film action sequence with minimum of quick cutting which like considering that nowadays action scene are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cut strung together and laid out for brain zapped mtv audience to pick apart nproblem is these action scene nearly all failed escape serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than filmed radio play ncharacter problem abound rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre the latter of which is not at least at this point something ben affleck is capable of pulling off nthe former he can do with ease and often the actor coast on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear nbut then suddenly affleck start growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating tarantino gangster ncharlize theron an extraordinary talent is like affleck playing whatever part the script requires her to play whether it be vulnerability at one moment anger at the next nshe never ha chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attribute frankenheimer ha her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this ngary sinise ha played this role frequently and here a in snake eye he doe the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same pace that going out of control is the only thing that keep him interested any more that it becomes more of an annoyance oh there he go again than threat nthese are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on

pay the rent nnello also ha rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful picture that have ever seen in either movie or in real life his hero is peter paul rubens the great flemish painter of the 17th century nnot that these are the only thing that make nello life happy however nhe ha dog of flanders whom he name patrasche who is heroic rin tin tin of the 19th century whom he rescue from his cruel unkind master nin addition he even ha best friend and future sweetheart in the lovely wealthy aloise whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with lower class nello he think he not good enough for her and he would hate the idea of the two kid marrying nbut then he wa poor guy himself before he married a mentioned later on in the film none day nello encounter mysterious yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande played wonderfully by jon voight who tell the boy to keep drawing from his heart and that perhaps one day he might land career in being an artist nand every christmas there is contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year the winner getting lot of money neager to save his home and his aging dying grandfather nello willingly decides to become an artist asking aloise to pose for him none night the two travel to circus where they have their fortune told one of the film most delightful scene that great happiness is destined for them nshe give the kid ring whom nello place on aloise hand afterwards the two kid have rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performer nunfortunately thing are not all la dee dah in this tale naloise father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again nbad enough that they can see each other although we know nello and aloise don we but that only the start of nello trouble naloise farm is burned down and nello is wrongfully accused by the landord of his cottage for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise nthis decrease nello reputation around the town save aloise and her parent and kindly miller william who is very sweet to nello every time he drop by nmatters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dy and he ha to pay for his funeral nbut then thing really get nasty when the landlord exile nello from his own home for not paying his rental permanetly nthis mean that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold freezing wind nworst of all the painting that he ha desperately been working on during all this time the portrait of the princess fails to win the prize at the festival nnow nello and patrasche are really depressed and close to freezing to death nwill nello be able to find any happiness in his life nwill patrasche save the day nwill nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise na dog of flanders is delightful heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kid of all age neven older one who consider themselves too sophisticated for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown ups too nthere have been other movie of this ilk boy and dog and while this one fall into that category it is mostly story about overcoming difficulty and finding good home for yourself nmove over or rather roll over old yeller this dog of flanders is heartwarming delight nthe cinematography courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful and really add to the powerful drama of the film nit also give feel of being in flanders the whole film wa respectably shot in flanders nthe music from richard friedman is also remarkable an evocative poignant score that recapture music from the 19th century nthe opening song over the credit is very beautiful hope the soundtrack is available and there a brief excerpt of cheer up charlie from willy wonka and the chocolate factory sung by aloise to nello in another delightful scene nthe cast is first rate jesse james and jeremy james kissner who play nello are some of the most endearing adorable young star have ever seen in my whole life so are the girl who play aloise madyline sweeten a the younger and farren monet a the older nnot that they are the only good star however njack warden is ideal a jehan eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character the scene involving him and nello are heartwarming touching one nalso bruce mcgill is charming a the kindly miller william nhe another one of my favorite character in the film nbut jon voight a mentioned before is the perfect choice for michel nhe brings mysterious yet gentle performance that make u all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he can win the contest nbut what make this film fun to watch is how well defined the character are and the pace of the story best of all it ha happy ending though will not give it away sorry is strong and powerful enough for u to identify with the character nfor the first time since the beginning of 1999 there come film which doesn rely on popular formula stuff such a big budget special effect commercial rock soundtrack or any of that stuff nthis one relies on telling fully character oriented story with just the right amount of heart humor and drama nthat to me is what make dog of flanders all the more delightful neleanor sullivan of the home news tribune noticed this and wa kind and generous enough to welcome it for want of better word glow surround dog of flanders nit heart is in the right place and it engages you nyou can guess where the film is going because this is well traveled territory but with pro like voight and appealing young performer like kissner an often told story is well worth revisit nin addition there were couple of other enthusiast such a chicago sun time and the washington post you should read their review they re really positive nother critic however were not so kind nstephen holden of the new york time had more than share of beating to lay upon dog of flanders via pen writing nhe found the film to be sea of sugary bromide and condemned mr voight character a hopelessly wooden adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda nin addition entertainment weekly slam dunked the film condemning it a the worst family film of the year nthere have been so many other bad review like this too nmy suggestion disregard the critic nthey just have big problem with touching family film and one should never pay attention to them nthis dog of flanders may only be little family movie it probably won be big hit in the style of titanic but then again no other film ha been since then but that is not bad thing in and of itself nthis is story that is sure to warm your heart and that is what really matter about dog of flanders nit is also one of the better family film around this year nnone of the other film have seen this year though they were good have been so low key and touching nif you re looking for family style entertainment look no further than this charming boy and dog yarn ngo see it while you still can for a mentioned it might not be big bow wow at the box office for long time nsee it while you can nthere is really no need to compare multi million dollar blockbuster such a star war episode the phantom menace or tarzan or even the iron giant with tender sweet little family

       " 'steven spielberg is now considered a one of the hollywood deity because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hit like jurassic park and oscar awarded critical triumph like schindler list nhowever in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating work of art that could slip in both category none of them is close encounter of the third kind extremely popular and influential science fiction spectacle nunfortunately it had bad luck to be released in the same year a star war nalthough both film have lot in common ground breaking special effect brilliant score by john williams their future wa different one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in it shadow nwhen spielberg began work on that project he wa already established a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit jaw ntogether with other young director of his new hollywood generation like kauffman carpenter hill and millius he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s when even the mainstream producer dared to experiment nironically it wa spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rule of blockubuster philosophy nbut in the mid 1970s many thing were different spielberg wa young and eager to use hollywood resource for his very personal and artistic movie nalthough very personal spielberg screenplay wa partly based on the book ufo experience by dr allen hynek and in many way inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitor to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2 nspielberg wa not only inspired by the mythology but his movie also gave the mythology itself huge boost unmatched until the contemporary era of file and the roswell anniversary nthat wa partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo related incident a the element of the plot nthe story begin with one of such incident team of international scientist come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the s navy plane of who went missing decade ago during the famous flight 19 nsuch event coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary richard dreyfus power company worker from muncie indiana who later becomes obsessed with his experience nbecause of his obsession he loses his job family and sanity but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler melinda dillon single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction nin the meantime the scientist decipher the strange signal from outer space and s government in co operation with the french led by lacombe francois truffaut begin with the preparation for ultra secret project nwhen the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary he finally see some sense in all his vision and begin the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area nthere he is joined by jillian who shared the similar vision ntwo of them must break through military picket and reach their destination to find whatever is there nspielberg here show great mastery by using the very same technique of jaw to make completely different effect nthe slow gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incident close encounter is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale nbut instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaw we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder nthroughout the movie the viewer know that something big magnificent and wonderful is about to happen and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end nthe last sequence with it even in this age impressive special effect by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull would leave many mouth open none of the great virtue of this film is it optimism naliens who almost always get portrayed a the monster in science fiction cinema are here benevolent and harmless creature and the first contact between them and humanity is beginning of something wonderful nit is very ironic when we consider that the two classic sf movie that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story howard hawk thing and byron haskin war of the world presented extraterrestrial a the threat to the mankind nspielberg humane approach and faith in the future also lie in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of it era the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post watergate portrayal of government a conspiratorial towards the public nbut even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chain smoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to file and it more cynical and disturbing vision nthere lie the main and probably the only flaw of this great picture lack of conflict and consequently lack of drama nthe movie ha few excitement or even action scene especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock north by northwest but generally almost everyone neary jillian government alien are the good guy ndespite such shortcoming the actor were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple role nrichard dreyfus is very convincing a ordinary yet nice guy who sink into insanity only to rediscover himself in grand finale nmelinda dillon wa on the other hand nominated for oscar a struggling mother yet she wa overshadowed by teri garr a neary long suffering wife ronnie napart from visual wonder of this film spielberg semi official composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music this time using the simple melody both a the element of plot and a the basis for his score nthe alien who are the main subject of this film were visually very convincing ntoo convincing one of my acquaintance in the ufo researching circle said naccording to him the depiction of extraterrestrial a grey skinned little people with big eye wa so accurate that it managed to freak out powerful government figure interested in suppressing the truth about ufo nso they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien this time designed to be anything but the real life nthe result wa t for many year the biggest commercial hit of all time yet le inspirational for ufo enthusiast nanyway whether the viewer belief in existence of extraterrestrial or ufo close encounter of the third kind remains the great movie and one of the rare uplifting experience in modern cinema',\n",

an unremittingly gorgeous film nkasi lemmon following up her brilliant 1997 debut _eve bayou_ which played on similar theme of manufactured reality and mysticism fulfills much of her immense promise with tale of seraph and lost boy artist and suffering n_the caveman valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in tilted landscape nclearly not for every taste when approached with the correct paradigm it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating film of the year redefinition of the hero archetype for post modern audience with urine stained wool trench coat in

       " 'a much a wanted to like this film a went into it the more pleased wa when left nfirst getting through all the usual line of newspaper glitz if you liked scream you ll love wild thing campbell give stunning performance this twisty plot will have you dazzled for day oh yeah the day newspaper us these is the day neve campbell fall in love with me nnow onto more serious stuff and with this film mean that in nearly sarcastic way nwild thing ha single handedly broken down the rule surrounding the rating from the mpaa ni not saying that in bad way but when you see this film you may be shocked by what you see nhowever perhaps the mpaa wa pleased by the film charming cast and tricky plot that they let the film slide with an rating nbeing mormon m bound to hear an uproar from religious zealot warning me not to see the film ntrouble is have already seen it nand like it nwild thing is film noir of the 90 filled with 40 sensibility and yet breaking the rule and modern day taboo of 90 culture nthe style in which it is filmed is rich in color nthe actor are all gorgeous people seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film nsure it all too good to be true but ain it fun to watch nwhen movie like this come along sort of better version of basic instinct there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it nthere will be people who don want to admit liking what they see but tell you most anyone who see this will like it nwild thing begin at blue bay high school the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into nit almost a if student are put through entrance exam just for admittance totally based on look alone nof course there are those select few who may look slightly ugly but compared to the average person they are gorgeous nimmediately the film find it tone and the audience settle in for an enjoyable time nwe can turn off our brain right nwrong nwhile you may be expecting one thing to happen it certainly doesn turn out that way nthe film begin in classroom with nearly all the main character present nthere sam lombardo matt dillon counselor for the student nhe heading the class discussion nthere also kelly van ryan denise richards snobby rich teen who ha fallen in love with sam nteaching the class however are two policeman ray duquette kevin bacon and gloria perez daphne rubin vega who want to talk about sex cheer crime boo what is sex crime nray asks not gettin any none student responds nthis pretty much set the tone of the film we are about to watch nhowever upon hearing this one student suzie toller neve campbell stand up and leaf the room commenting that they can both kiss part of her body nand so wild thing set into motion nquickly kelly begin hitting on sam but sam doesn want anything to do with her advance nkelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him nshe even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep nsurprisingly that really all can tell you about the plot nany more would give away one of the many crucial plot twist nand what more these plot twist are actually unpredictable ngoing along the way of scream wild thing maintains that film surprise and then add even more to them nthere are more plot twist in this film than probably any have ever seen nand even though you think you may get tired of them the surprise are so genuine that it rather pleasing ngoing back over them in my mind nearly all of them work though some stretch the boundary of belief nthankfully the convoluted plot doesn give u much time to think about each one pouncing yet another twist on u before the shock of the previous one ha worn off na for the critic who complain that the film is trashy well it is nthis is pretty much just one trashy film nhowever it is the kind of trashy that isn hard to watch nit good trash in sense none the screenplay know that it not to be taken seriously and it includes lot of humor and satire into the story nthis varies everywhere from kelly mother theresa russell who is more of caricature of rich people all the way to an ambulance chasing lawyer bill murray who wear neck brace to cover an insurance scam he is running nbill murray also provides the best character in the film and most of the genuine laugh nand two the sex is more than gratuitous although not unwelcomed nwild thing is supposed to have sex in it what film with that title wouldn and this movie break the boundary ninstead of having heterosexual sex scene it also includes lesbian scene between denise richards and neve campbell don worry nit not a graphic a you might think nthe heterosexual scene are quite graphic but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon full frontal nude scene nit very brief so if you blink you may miss ahem it nand for a long a can remember don think have seen an rated film show an erect one before it not completely but judging from the audience reaction it wa more than they expected too nalso during one scene late in the film there seemed to be relationship brewing between bacon and dillon character but nothing came of it make you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the rating or if the actor refused to do it nwhat first made me want to see wild thing wa it cast nneve campbell of course ha been one of my favorite actress since the scream film were released nhere however she turn every typical role she ha done on it head and play gothic pothead nthe closest role to this wa her performance in the craft though even in that she wa nice girl ncampbell is probably the best in the film and show her wide range of talent nyou can tell she will be around for long time ndenise richards will also be around for long time although she may be limited to the role without much range nhere she get to express more emotion than in her stiff yet effective performance in starship trooper nhopefully one day she will land very good role that can display her ability nand then there is daphne rubin vega newcomer to the movie nshe give very good performance although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and half ntowards the end she doe get bigger part non the male side matt dillon is probably the best giving subtle performance that surprise with every twist nkevin bacon ha slightly wooden character but he make the most of it nyou must have admiration though for what he did on screen nand judging from many of the woman reaction in the theater to that shot they have grown deeper appreciation for bacon yeah right nand then there is bill murray nhis performance is the comic relief and he nearly steal the film na whole the entire cast work wondrously together and they seem at home even when doing the menage troi ndirector john mcnaughton who ha previously done the critically acclaimed henry portrait of serial killer ha constructed wonderfully twisty plot that work nhis direction is smooth and stylish nthe visuals are striking filled with rich color and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air nhowever he seems more at home when the actor aren talking nhis fly by shot of the swampy area are brilliant and his photography of denise richards climbing out of the pool is highlight nthe cinematography is gorgeous in it detail it not often that you see film like this and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take picture nthen there is the music nthis wa probably the most obvious thing to me a it set the perfect mood for the film nit hard to describe in word so just see the film and listen to it nit wonderfully composed and presented nand be sure to stick around during the closing credit nmcnaughton ha finally put the ending credit to good use while most comedy use it for outtake nhe ha included some small scene which help explain the preceding event nsome may say that these are lame attempt to explain the convoluted plot but it an entertaining way to finish the film nplus there are some shocking moment in these ending credit which just add to the fun nwild thing is appropriately rated for strong sexuality nudity language and violence nagain the nudity is rather unnecessary but let face it people want to see it nso why not give it to them nneve campbell admirably ha no nudity clause in her contract and the most you see of her is from behind a she take her top off way to go neve nthe sex scene are graphic especially the first one we see between the mother and one of her deck hand none almost wonder how they got away with the rating nthe language is quite harsh too ranging from sexual innuendo to your average everyday profanity nand can stress it enough don allow kid under 18 to see this film nthe target age for the movie is the 18 24 range and that who should see it nit definitely not for those under 18 ndid mention that this film is rated however for those that do get chance to watch it you will probably more likely be pleased and may even take friend to see it the next time',\n",

dialogue in supergirl ni ll admit it ni love superman iii ni know it hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it a nothing more than vehicle for richard pryor but still think it a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise nsupergirl spin off film of sort from the series same producer alexander and ilya salkind doesn even rival superman iii in term of quality let alone superman or superman ii nsupergirl lost me from the opening scene and went steadily downhill for the rest of it two hour plus running time na the film begin we see the resident of argo city commune like place consisting of refugee from krypton which resides in inner space go about their daily life nok nwhat nso these are exile from krypton which blew up right nwere they living there before krypton exploded nhow do you get to inner space nthis whole inner space notion is never explained particularly in term of how these people get information from the outside world nhow do they know where superman went nhow do they know he took the name clark kent and now work at the daily planet nthese kind of thing frustrate the hell out of me nargo city is kept running by power source called the omegahedron none day the founder of argo city zaltar peter toole give the omegahedron to superman cousin kara helen slater for use a inspiration in her art nkara us it to create bug like thing which immediately crash through the layer of whatever that protects the city nin the chaos the omegahedron sail out through the opening dooming the argonians to death nin three day time or something nkara then climb into pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chase after the omegahedron to save her world nthe power source travel directly to earth and land in the bowl of dip belonging to minor league witch named selena faye dunaway who immediately before her dip wa ruined announced her desire to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel peter cook nselena somehow know that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plan and she set out to achieve world domination nselena is unaware of course that kara ha also arrived on earth and that she arrived a supergirl complete with appropriate costume nsupergirl emerges from the bottom of lake when she arrives nok nhuh nwhy doe the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoot out of the bottom of lake nattention movie explain yourself ni sorry can only suspend disbelief so much ni can buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie want me to nknowing that she need secret identity supergirl basically will herself into school girl outfit complete with different hairstyle pick the alias linda lee and enrolls into school nshe given her dorm assignment and who happens to be her roommate nlois lane sister lucy nok coincidence is one thing folk but we re getting really contrived now nwhat follows are some generic all girl school hijinks ncomplete with evil bully girl mean for no reason of course and even shower scene nbest moment though come when supergirl decides to put bra on over her school uniform and start stuffing it with sock nat this point m rapidly wondering why m bothering with this nonsense nthere is some credit to give to the film however none lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an evil bulldozer destroying small town in search of it prey is very well done nalso it commendable to see gender reversed in the film whereas the woman have all the power and the men are merely object and tool nhart bochner die hard is particularly fun a kara love interest lovesick landscaper who is under spell cast by selena although he is unfortunately part of one of the film more ridiculous moment when he ha to be rescued from being tapped by some menacing bumper car nthen there were numerous little thing that bothered me nthe flying effect are never convincing for moment nit all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wire ninstead of having her look like she flying the filmmaker wanted her to be graceful so she pose lot and doe ballet type maneuver nalso who are the first two human to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth na pair of truck driver rapist who immediately attack her and then meet wacky demise nthere is also some rampant product placement in the film most notably for popeye tylenol and w root beer with the latter actually putting it logo on the shirt of one of the rapist nfinally just one word monster nfaye dunaway and peter toole ham it up unmercifully however when toole overacts he entertaining and when dunaway doe it she annoying her character actually say the line seize them nat one point ndunaway henchman played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro fare much better with vaccaro coming off best a the equivalent of ned beatty otis character from the first two superman movie nhelen slater effectively portrays supergirl a the innocent naive character she written to be a she able to gaze at flower and bunny with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable nbelievability aside though it still annoying nnow despite all this negativity and m not alone here supergirl is not well liked nor well respected movie in many circle leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested but excited about it release on dvd nthey have released two separate edition of the film on dvd to the delight of many people including myself nyet m still unclear a to why since this movie is so awful nthe first and most widely available dvd release feature the international version of the film which run 10 minute longer than the print which ran in s theater nthe movie is presented in it original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 35 1 is enhanced for 16x9 television and ha been remastered in full thx glory nextras on the disc include full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and special project consultant scott michael bosco the excellent 50 minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl the making of feature dig that workout montage 5 trailer 3 tv spot talent bios in depth storyboards accompanied by score from the movie and assorted still gallery nthe transfer on this international version is incredible nyou think you were watching new release nimages are sharp color jump off the screen and the picture is free of scratch or artifact nonly some special effect sequence show the wear of time and there just isn much that can be done about that unless you re obsessive like george lucas nthe new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right place however you ll be hearing absurd dialogue and mediocre jerry goldsmith score which is completely unrelated to john williams classic superman theme and sound better suited for cannon film golan globus production nthe commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentary nbosco seems to be an expert in all thing supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there no dead air on the track nbosco probe szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that come onscreen and we learn great deal more about the film a result of his participation nalthough at time you can tell that bosco is looking for specific response from szwarc and is surprised when he doesn get that response nwe learn some fascinating tidbit on the track most notably the almost appearance in the film by christopher reeve ngreat detail is given about superman proposed role in the original script before reeve wisely dropped out na it stand superman is written off early on in the film when we hear radio broadcast mention that he is billion of light year away on some sort of peace mission nfor the sake of brevity won even get into that one nszwarc also reveals that is wa the conscious decision of the salkinds and everyone else agreed that supergirl needed to stand on it own replacing the science fiction of the superman film with cutsy whimsical fantasy nonsense nbosco also point out scene not in the american release a they come along claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been hit at the box office nagain for the sake of brevity won even get into that one nanchor bay ha also released limited edition only 50 000 copy pressed two disc set ndisc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release ndisc two feature the never before seen director cut of the film which run 138 minute long nthe addition mainly consist of scene extension which don add much of note except for few moment which lengthen peter toole screen time particularly during his latter appearance nthe print is rough in spot and the sound is only in mono but fan of the film won care none question though nshouldn the director commentary be on the director cut of the film ni never seen supergirl before sat down to watch this dvd ni wa nine when it wa released to theater and even then wa smart enough to inform my parent not to take me to see it nso when popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair had no idea what to expect ni knew the film wasn beloved and never had any interest in it before but wa willing to give it shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc na the disc began to spin wa rather impressed with the opening sequence which made me sit up and wonder if my assumption all this time could have been wrong ncome to find out however it wa just the chase digital stereo logo nso slunk back into my seat a the nightmare started nat the end of the film supergirl fly back into the lake with the omegahedron and fly back to argo city nugh give up ni surprised even made it to the end of the film not once not twice but three time to review these disc

story build to tense moment or what appears to be intended to be tense moment but then let the tension dissolve nwhile the tension dissipates one character start singing song and in each plotline the major character sing along even though they are not in the same scene nthen toward the end the story each build to tense moment again nit is almost a if the character are somehow psychically linked nthis creates some strange effect nthe story are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationship nthe strand have varying degree of bizarre content nwe have the story of dying man earl partridge jason robards wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends nphil parma philip seymour hoffman is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal npartridge young

former quiz kid donnie smith william macy nthe film juggle all these story for over three hour but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily neach story move toward single bizarre common climax but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story nthe common climax itself is ambiguous in many way and it fails to really tie up any of the story nthe film seems to be built around strange event and weird history but it really ha little to do with the content of the story though they all are connected in part by one weird event nmagnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson though in my opinion his two previous film hard eight and boogie night were better told story nit is interesting that one start to look forward to actor from anderson company njohn reilly seems to be standard fixture nparticularly notable is philip baker hall who gave mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight nhere he several of the character are mesmerizing but that characteristic is not really used na study of character these story are each worth following na well rounded story with beginning middle and end they leave something to be desired nbut the film is willing to do the unexpected and that help make the film worth sitting through ni rate it 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale nheavy spoiler nheavy spoiler nheavy spoiler nheavy spoiler nduring the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple message from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really doe happen nand in actual fact it doe nsince biblical time rain of frog have been interpreted a sign of displeasure of the god nit is however perfectly natural if somewhat unnerving phenomenon nthe cause is associated with whirlwind nwe know that tornado over land can rip up land and even object of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air holding them aloft nthe reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister nsmaller object can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updraft for surprisingly long period of time much a hail and chunk of ice are nwhen the whirlwind is over water animal near the surface frequently fish and frog may suffer the same fate nessentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind held aloft by updraft and finally dropped elsewhere nso while the rain is possible some doubt do creep in nthe rain of frog depicted in this film may be of greater scale than had pictured for rain of frog nit seems unlikely the frog would still be alive when dropped nit is not clear that geographic condition are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon frankly have no idea on these point notherwise the event wa quite believable nwhat we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomenon we saw in volcano nin the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is sign from god since there are many reference to exodus 8 2 and the frog shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servant nhowever rain of frog though it feel biblical is most definitely not biblical portent nnote that the previous verse say and the river shall bring forth frog abundantly which shall go up nso the bible is referring not to rain but to an infestation from the river nthe only other reference to frog in the bible is a symbol for uncleanness in

       " 'frequent error is the categorization of terrorist a soldier or common criminal na soldier commits act of violence sanctioned by one nation state against another na common criminal commits act of violence for personal gain na terrorist employ random violence a mean to political end nif the target nation doe not affect the desired change in policy the violence continues nit is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone even total innocent anywhere at anytime that give the figure his label nedward zwick the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united state nyou think the opening bit wa ripped right from the headline narab terrorist kill american citizen abroad and the s responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack nhowever unlike the real life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden camp and manufacturing facility the film version depicts special operation troop kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal nin retaliation the terrorist bring the fight to the new world nunwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent in charge anthony hubbard denzel washington who work out of the bureau new york office at one federal plaza nwhile investigating series of bombing in the big apple he encounter cia agent elise kraft annette bening also trying to uncover information ngenerally the fbi is charged with problem inside the s while the cia take care of problem in the international realm neven spy from other country are off limit to the cia a long a they are in our country nhubbard therefore find it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory but a the two form tentative professional relationship hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiance and possibly illegal action involving terrorism and the united state government nthe original tagline for patriot game wa there ha never been terrorist attack on american soil nhowever true it wa pulled before the movie release because it sounded too much like dare nrevisiting the scenario of foreign terrorist committing act of violence in the united state the siege is almost an invitation in itself because it show just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operation here in america nadmittedly the terror wrought upon new york is bit excessive who going to believe that few bomb are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of bus or to curtail their shopping by two third but the basic premise is still valid ni liked the fact that this film rise above the basic action thriller fare of good guy men against bad guy terrorist by exploring some of the effect on society and law and order nit provides very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of few arab would escalate into series of hate crime against the arab american population and that in an effort to find the terrorist the civil liberty of the minority may be violated by the government itself nin fact about halfway through the film when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city the liberty of all american are put at risk nalthough it may actually be side effect of terrorist campaign the demise of social order in america is scary thought and goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist group nthroughout the film maintains conflict between hubbard who want to use the fbi to pursue the terrorist within the letter of the law and general devereaux bruce willis who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorist more forcefully nwhat result is fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war power act utilizing philosophy and historical example to make point on both side nit actually get rather heady at time but it a credit to screenwriter zwick lawrence wright and menno meyjes that they don underestimate the intelligence of the audience ni don know if it his tone or inflection or something else but denzel washington ha way of spitting out dialog that make whatever he say sound great nthis combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid level authority figure make his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable nannette bening give one of the more assertive portrayal of female character ve seen recently and the chemistry she share with washington is palpable nit somewhat unfortunate that her character fortitude is broken at certain point but it allows u to watch bening play little more range nbruce willis is pretty much relegated to tough guy role always standing straight and with permanent scowl fixed upon his face nhowever the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is major drive behind the film development nnotable is tony shalhoub who play fbi agent frank haddad lebanese immigrant nthe role call for evidencing both kind of filial pride for his heritage and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society ndifficult to say the least shalhoub doe it with naturalness you can almost reach out and touch nperhaps best known for his role a antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom wing shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic ability in the wonderful film big night nwhereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick favorite actor he directed washington in glory and courage under fire james horner seems to be his favorite composer ni therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score writer graeme revell seven film this year already over horner for the siege until realized that this film contained lot of arabian themed music and horner record ha shown more of propensity for score either neutral in ethnicity or irish sounding at most nrevell doe good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scene and allowing the score to enhance the movie a whole nit nowhere near a intrusive a in some of the other film we ve been getting throughout the year nmissteps in the siege can be found in couple of the excess it take nfor example it pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick nunfortunately there a scene where the army just cut loose against some arab immigrant in blatant display of firepower and explosion obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye catching nin the middle of the city and against no real opposition zwick even ha the army use cobra attack helicopter to shoot rocket into building no farther than 50 foot from friendly troop nverisimilitude really go out the window at that point nthe film also get little preachy toward the end focusing on the ability of different race to get along na noble gesture the film just put the message across bit too obviously nthese flaw are glaring but they don detract too much from an otherwise good film that make you think about issue you may not have considered since history class',\n",

plenty of kiss along with some ac dc ramones and thin lizzy nthen again maximum overdrive had an awesome soundtrack me being the big ac dc fan that am but is probably one of the worst movie of all time detroit rock city doesn quite reach that level of ineptitude but it get dangerously close nin fact the music is the only thing that keep this movie from being complete failure in my mind nbasically the soundtrack ha earned the film full half star which mean all the band involved can pat themselves on the back except for marilyn manson whose half hearted cover of ac dc highway to hell

dead turkey of movie nedward furlong ha done far better work than this and so ha natasha lyonne and so ha lin shaye but hey they ve got to make living in hollywood npeople wanting to see kiss and lot of it will probably be disappointed considering the band appears for about five minute and play one song ntoo bad they might have provided some energy to this mess ndirector adam rifkin know he hasn got much material to work with so he take chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keep his camera spinning nwe get an endless parade of quick cut split screen zoom out zoom in and rotating

       " 'seen august 8 1998 at 6 m at rotterdam square cinema rotterdam ny theater 6 by myself for free using my sony loews critic pas theater rating good seat sound and picture nwar is topic that can help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the medium nmovies documentary and even history book have way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspect are focused on such a strategy politics and victory nit easy to forget war in it most basic form is battle of army out to slaughter each other nforgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier no matter what his rank or importance is real flesh and blood person and not just number saving private ryan is one of the few film that dare play up this aspect especially in it unapologetic realistic delivery nit prof there a huge difference between battling and killing nthe film open with one of the most graphic disturbing scene in recent memory nit world war ii day to be exact and the s military is invading omaha beach where the nazi are more than ready for them nspielberg us many technique to create for total sense of reality ninstead of positioned camera the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operator running alongside soldier a if they were just a scared nthere is no sense of stability but of constant anxious and confusing motion giving u the feeling of being in the middle of the battle and just vulnerable a the poor troop poor is proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are nthere is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any character nwe don get the feeling these are handsome actor playing heroic role but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reason beyond their understanding nthe nazi are not portrayed a enemy to be hated but a people that must be destroyed because they re there nin the movie the good guy can run through firestorm of bullet and bomb and not get scratch but in reality that wouldn happen nthe men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flank and dead body nthey are sitting duck and we realize this through the perspective of the well secured german who can actually see who what and where they re shooting unlike the american who must fire in general direction to avoid getting their head blown off nperhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are but that seems to be part of the theme nthe film seems to rely on the audience sense of patriotism that the american military is right and good and that the nazi are inherently evil nthe battle scene eventually focus on group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold whole 50 foot progression and begin to inflict some damage ni have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazi sprang up couldn help but feel some sense of joy and relief nto triumph against all odds is cliche to be sure but there nothing cliche about the graphic detailed atmosphere here because it really happened none of the most surprising aspect of the film is how little story construction there is and yet the event that take place make sense and are interesting nthe plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldier we meet ntom hank star a captain miller relatively average man who happens to be the leader of platoon nhe never obsessive or any such generic cartoonish characteristic that might dominate character like this nhe doesn want to be there any more than his men but when he is given mission he intends to carry it out nthe mission the film is concerned with is a the title state saving private ryan nthrough series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker it is brought to general attention that three brother from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notice of each death simultaneously nwhen they learn fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe they make it top priority to have him returned safely to his mother nit easy to sympathize with this situation after all no one should have to lose all their child at once nbut finding one man in this war is a miller put it like trying to find needle in stack of needle nthe saving of private ryan isn just dramatic device but thematic one nhis salvation represents the sense of innocence the country the world even wa trying to convince itself it still had nwhen miller company hears of the mission they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead but miller isn so quick to shrug it off nhe know the only thing that can really save soldier from death is hope and now he ha the opportunity to make someone sense of hope reality nthe mission to find ryan give miller group destination but not direction nalong the way many thing happen to them both good and bad na few battle are fought not to be major accomplishment for the war but because they encounter german soldier and have no other choice nthe act of killing itself becomes one of the film major philosophical metaphor nthe soldier don mind killing other soldier in blind battle but when they come across lone survivor who begs them to let him go they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood a some kind of vengeance for their loss nunfortunately death is fact of war and most film try to avoid it when it come to the main character but here spielberg doesn want u to think these men are invincible nin fact only small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man and the performance are good enough to make this method work nalthough the character are somewhat typical the actor maintain control over the material at all time nwhether they re arguing with each other telling story of back home or fighting the german they never go overboard and always seem believable nsure there a zinger here and there but war doesn change the fact boy will be boy nif and when one dy we too can feel the loss even though we hardly knew them nthe final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous violent battle sequence nprivate ryan ha been found but facing four to one odds can the american defeat the german and keep ryan alive nthat not premise for thrill it symbolic of everything the film ha worked for nit would be wrong to say the film ha either happy or sad ending it end the way it must end ni remember reading calvin hobbes comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like dad how do army of men killing each other solve problem saving private ryan is the adult version of that question',\n",

niccol writer director of gattaca introduces some interesting question such a the ethic of subjecting person to this type of life or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life ha all been fake nalthough these question came to mind don think the film itself asked them nit certainly didn address them or try to answer them ni wa particularly disappointed that the film didn deal more with the trauma of learning one life is tv show ncarrey performance at the end showed smidgen of truman pain but almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film pacing nearlier in

it that way nperhaps it not fair to criticize movie for what it isn but it seems like there were some missed opportunity here nbut on it own term the movie is well made nsight sound and pacing are all

from powaqqatsi permeates truman scene of suspicion and awakening glass ha small cameo a keyboardist for the show nand the pacing of the story wa brisk nthere wa no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show just few quick title card few interview and then right into the show and the movie none of the first scene is of the studio light falling there wa no token scene of truman idyllic life before it fall apart because it wasn necessary we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble and no sooner nthere also no point in the movie where the plot slows down nit a quick straight shot to the movie end nin term of overall quality would compare the truman show to niccol gattaca nboth film are well made with interesting story set in interesting world nbut neither

decide to screen the film so hastily scheduled wa the screening that myers last name wa misspelled on the invitation not to mention the numerous typo in the press note for medium audience that came away noticeably le than impressed myself included nand with good reason somehow some way the supremely disappointing _54_ ha made the historically hip haven of hedonism nboring nalthough christopher ha distanced himself from the finished film he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_ lifelessness n_54_ focus for the most part on tight knit trio of employee at the club coat check girl

turn the meaty story to be told at studio 54 are not the worker but those of the people who went there to party not necessarily the numerous vip guest but the wild eccentric who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club famously hard as doorman and dance among other thing the night away with the rich famous and infamous the only taste of the crowd come by way of ellen dow feisty dottie

themselves club hopping preppies featured at least one extended dance scene ndancing isn the only thing glazed over in _54_ so is the sex but that may not be entirely christopher fault nfrom what ve heard his original vision wa something considerably more dark and daring starting with the shane character he wa conceived and actually filmed a wild morally ambiguous bisexual which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54 legend nbut somewhere between principal photography and the final cut shane wa defanged and quite literally straightened out consequently so wa the film naside from brief glimpse of erotic encounter toward the beginning of the film shane fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie sela ward and an abbreviated bedhopping montage the sexual dimension is just about ignored nshane in this incarnation is sanitized to the point of blandness an idealistic do gooder who pine for frequent guest at the club julie black campbell worldly soap star with yes heart of gold nthis tacked on romance would have been slightly le tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience nthey fail on both count nultimately _54_ failure come down to three letter u na in there isn any to be had for the audience ntoo much time is spent with the boring shane and too little is spent on the club floor where all the action took place nanyhow though whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively nwhen anita finally get her big break and perform onstage at the club it should be euphoric height for her the crowd and the audience however the moment doesn get chance to reach that level for it is cut short by moment of forced sentimentality which also mar the film conclusion one of the last minute reshoots nstrangely upbeat and wistful the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying nthere is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there

       " 'mpaa not rated though feel it would likely be pg for martial art violence nwith three movie already re released theatrically in america and at least three more on their way jackie chan is one of the newest hot property in action adventure stardom and it just about time nfor over twenty five year jackie been starring in martial art and action movie in hong kong thrilling audience with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial art and wonderful sense of comedy drunken master ha the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to make it big this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong ni not entirely sure why exactly nin many way drunken master is similar to most of jackie other early film such a fearless hyena and ii master with cracked finger half loaf of kung fu spiritual kung fu and others nin fact looking at all these early film together one get the impression that they were stamped out cookie cutter style at rate of four to six per year all using the same cast and telling very similar story nto be honest think that early jackie chan movie are something of an acquired taste nthey re quite different from action movie a we know them in america nthese film tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past with fairly slow plot that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scene together drunken master though it plot is tighter than some is no exception a an aside drunken master wa the first jackie chan movie ever saw and saw it the way it wa meant to be seen in na movie theater in seattle a part of an asian film festival nat the time didn really think it wa anything special but nafter having seen more film like it it kind of grown on me drunken master storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movie such a fearless hyena and ii and master with cracked finger slacker martial art student is taught the martial art by harsh seeming master and ha big fight with an evil bad guy in the end formula that ha been adapted to put it kindly by american film such a karate kid nmore specifically jackie chan play the part of wong fei hong aka naughty panther fun loving practical joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good but not _quite_ good enough nafter embarrassing his instructor assistant by beating him roundly then beating up bully in marketplace wong fei hong try to hit on pretty girl but discovers that she and her mother can hit back better than he can and ni further chagrinned to discover that the two woman are his cousin and aunt respectively nhis father wong kei ying is unhappy about this and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damage nkei ying soon institute harsh regimen of punishment which fei hong doe not like at all nwhile escaping from this punishment fei hong meet up with drunken old man who proceeds to thrash him soundly then take him on a student and thrash him some more nthis turn out to be su hua chi legendary master of drunken style kung fu nhe assigns fei hong series of bizarre task such a filling jug with water while hanging upside down from frame cracking walnut with his hand and other such exercise that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up nthen when he ready he teach him the seven style of drunken kung fu nunfortunately the lazy fei hong only practice six of them drunken master feature some wonderful martial art sequence with jackie winning some fight and losing others nit been said before but ll say it again these fight don just _happen_ they re a carefully choreographed a any ballet performance and it show nin his fight jackie often make use of object found in his environment bench jug cup bowl fruit and vegetable often in new and surprising way nthe fight scene particularly those toward the end of the film are unparallelled in most american film nwhether jackie win or loses it really something to see and nit often a funny a anything too nand funny is the other thing jackie chan is very very good at nthere very little that new in this movie jackie winning fight jackie getting beaten badly by master jackie going through punishment or training these nschticks have all been seen before in any one of several dozen similar jackie movie from the seventy and early eighty nbut they re still hilarious a ever nlikewise jackie ha _great_ supporting cast many of whom were also in other early jackie film and they re often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own nthe really big thing about drunken master though that inspired several copycat including couple starring jackie himself and sequel fifteen year later wa the drunken style kung fu ni not certain whether or not this is actually genuine style of kung fu but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movement of drunkard to lull the enemy into false sense of security and nit apparently help if you re drunk while you re doing it ngenuine or not have to admit there just something incredibly fun about watching fellow who look utterly sloshed wading into group of startled opponent and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what going on ncome to think of it perhaps this element is what account for this film success over any of the other jackie film it nnot just martial art it the kind of martial art that make you stop and go whoa non the negative side the cinematography in this film is nothing special the film stock is rather primitive the plot is often rather slow and the subtitle are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background gone with the wind this isn nstill if you like martial art film or like what you ve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more give it shot nit much more real than chuck norris or jean claude van damme nyou might very well like it nanother interesting thing about drunken master ha to do with it video availability in the u drunken master is the only early jackie chan movie that know of that you can find in it original letterboxed hong kong subtitled form commercially available on vhs from magnum video in gold box for about 10 nthere are plenty of other early jackie film around but these are typically either in dubbed pan and scanned form or else import tape priced for rental instead of purchase nthankfully drunken master at least is available in the aspect ratio in which it wa meant to be seen at very affordable price nif you like drunken master take look at the numerous other early jackie chan film that are out there even the dubbed one aren really _too_ bad if nnothing else you can enjoy the martial art choreography while making fun of the dialogue ni particularly recommend spiritual kung fu half loaf of kung fu the fearless hyena movie and snake crane art of shaolin nalso the mostly unrelated storywise sequel drunken master ii will hit theater in american release sometime later this year though what it american release title will be is still uncertain and come _highly_ recommended by this reviewer nalso for rather different interpretation of the character wong fei hong who is in fact popular figure from chinese folklore ve been told to suggest the once upon time in china series starring jet li though haven personally seen any of them yet nif you choose to watch drunken master really hope you enjoy it and hope it start to open your eye to the wonderful world of asian cinema that out there nall in all give this film an',\n",

nunfortunately for the devil advocate this ending nearly collapse in on itself and ruin the entire film nnevertheless the film doe provide two and half hour of pure entertainment note to self kill whomever wa in charge of the preview for this film ni don think wa quite prepared for this movie because the trailer made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan nwell it doe contain this element but what is not mentioned in the ad is the other plot element and seemingly more interesting one at that nthe devil advocate begin in florida with an ongoing trial in session nkevin lomax keanu reef is the defense attorney working for client whom ha been accused of raping young girl nhe end up with not guilty verdict despite an emotional testimony from the victim heather matarazzo nhe leaf the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann charlize theron where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose good jury nhe accepts mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive and he fly to new york with his wife nafter proving his worth for selecting jury and his perfect winning streak in court the head of the firm john milton al pacino asks him to work permanently a criminal lawyer nhe graciously accepts where he is treated almost a god nhe is given an incredible apartment which is bigger than my entire house now and hefty paycheck nhis life seems to be on the rise nand of course his life suddenly begin to waver and slowly decline nhe is attracted to fellow employee christabella connie nielson and his wife begin to feel very lonely in her large apartment nmary ann take up friendship with neighbor who always give advice especially if it is not wanted nmeanwhile kevin nabs case surrounding alexander cullen craig nelson who apparently murdered three people nhe spends hour upon hour with this case while forgetting his loving wife who may or may not be going insane nall of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself nafter while thing turn completely upside down a kevin wife claim to have seen monstrous image superimposed on her friend na fellow employee is murdered in the park and his mother judith ivey reveals information about kevin real father ni it all just big nightmare nor is john milton really satan playing trick with kevin life nthe devil advocate play out fairly straight forward but for some odd reason the screenwriter wanted to surprise everyone by giving u something we don expect ni this surprise conclusion supposed to make u feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed nif so the devil advocate mess up completely and ironically felt more depressed because of the ending a is now than would have if it had ended ten minute early ni went into the devil advocate expecting shocking horror film and that is exactly what got ni wa settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally and that is what got nbut what wa the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending did mention that didn like the ending nthe producer of this film take you on thrilling roller coaster ride and just a it is ending they pull the rug out from under you nfilms like se7en and the usual suspect can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected more or le nwe know it is going to end in an unpredictable way nthe devil advocate on the other hand end unpredictably not from u knowing lot but knowing nothing at all nif that is confusing recommend watching the film and then reading that again na for the film overall enjoyed the entire first two hour being drawn in by terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study nthe film run like well built clock slowly building until finally exploding with highly charged climax and an unpredictable one at that nand then you settle in for nice resolution which doe not occur nit wa at this point that felt cheated ntaking u on terror ride of intrigue we follow kevin lomax around a he is the centerpiece of the film neverything occurs from his perspective nhe is our representation on screen sort of nbut we are forced to witness conclusion which make most of the film seem like game ni don want to spoil the ending so all can say is go see the film and decide for yourself nperhaps the most shocking thing about the devil advocate is the extreme amount of everything nit earned it rating for reason nthere is plenty of nudity sex violence gore and then you have gore violence sex and more nudity nthis film really isn subtle about anything showing u everything nit actually surprise me that this film did not receive an nc 17 rating a it is quite harsh nhowever the movie doe have it merit and nudity and sex are among those ni don condone sex and nudity in film but if it there might a well enjoy it nthe biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch nthe confrontation between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining but what stand out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife mary ann nportrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron mary ann problem are incredibly intense and found myself wanting to witness her decline nthis may sound uncaring but wanted to watch because felt sorry for her nshe is the most interesting character on the screen who is forced into world where she is not wanted nsomething the devil advocate contained actually shocked me for reason other than extreme violence and nudity especially for film of this nature nthe story actually ha something to say about humanity nin one of the last scene john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god play with his child he is satan of course nhe comment that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity nthen god set up rule which contradict human nature nthis semi religious bashing is more humorous than frightening nwhat milton say is so true about our society that found myself laughing out loud partially thinking it wa funny but patially realizing it wa true nthese moral dilemma are present throughout the devil advocate giving it an added depth many film skip over in their writing but m sure they came straight from the novel it wa based on nwhen film ha something to say about our society it deserves to be watched nthe cast of the devil advocate is one of the highlight a we see memorable face and they put spin on those memorable face we don expect nheather matarazzo make brief appearance a the terrorized victim in the opening court case and she doe great job nprobably the big surprise of this film is keanu reef nhe ha proven himself an uneven actor success such a speed and bomb such a johnny mnemonic but he top himself with this performance ni have never seen him more believable to date nal pacino is of course the scene stealer nhis devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson the witch of eastwick and max von sydow needful thing nhe could have easily gone too far over the top in many scene but he remains completely believable if that is the correct term njeffrey jones mostly known a the principal in ferris bueller day off also give good performance a eddie barzoon njudith ivey manages credible performance a the mother who hold secret to kevin past nconnie nielson is very effective in her role and she also appears naked several time none familiar face with twist wa coach star craig nelson who give very good performance nthe devil advocate is rated for sexuality nudity violence language and some gore nat 144 minute this film move along fairly quickly nfor the first two hour sat completely engaged in the good performance and strong character nthe technical quality is also remarkable with great special effect and good musical score ndirector taylor hackford ha managed to create very disturbing motion picture only to ruin good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minute ni guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that went into the theater expecting disturbing film and hackford gave me just that for long time nbut just before the end he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream npersonally would have preferred it ending fifteen minute early',\n",

given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly replete with chapped dirty hand and rumpled clothing nhe wear hooded sweatshirt which he often pull over his head giving him monk like appearance nthere are no acrobatic back flip and shiny super gun in his arsenal nhe us old worn weapon and simply go about his task in economical efficient and pleasureless fashion nghost dog is

speak often going for long period without doing so nthe fact that whitaker can convey such wide range of emotion through gesture or look is remarkable talent nalthough the film ha deliberate pace some of the late night drive and walk taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down ntruly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob nhe reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world ncarried on the shoulder of remarkable performance by whitaker ghost

       " 'historical epic a genre wa almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s nfor many critic scholar and most importantly film producer it wa thing of the past something that could have attracted crowd only in the era of black and white television and non cgi special effect nbut in 1995 same a in the case of dance with wolf five year ago there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talent of actor producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre nand same a in the case of dance with wolf he wa awarded for his effort with oscar nthe name of the film wa braveheart and the name of it director and main actor wa mel gibson nthe plot chronicle the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace 1272 1305 nin his time english king edward longshanks played by patrick mcgoohan ha almost completely subdued entire british isle including scotland whose proud inhabitant are now subjected by ius primae noctis and various other form of humiliation and oppression by english knight nalthough english had killed his father many year ago young scottish commoner william wallace played by mel gibson doesn care about politics and want only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron played by catherine maccormack nmurron death change that and wallace take arm and together with small but dedicated band of follower begin guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country nthrough time more and more people join his rank and in 1298 wallace rag tag army score surprising victory against english knight in the battle of stirling bridge nbut the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabble between scot themselves especially noble under pretender robert the bruce played by angus macfadyen who wouldn like to have simple commoner a national leader nbraveheart wa only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson so it wouldn be fair to compare it to the better known genre classic directed by david lean or anthony mann nhowever even when we apply such criterion braveheart is more than decent historical epic that take new and refreshing approach to the genre nthe most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism nwhile older hollywood film set in medieval europe used to give fairytale like vision of picturesque castle splendid costume and knight in shining armour gibson show u the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life wa hard short and brutish nthis general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scene of battle where hand to hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all it gory detail never seen since verhoeven ultra naturalistic flesh blood ncompared with this naturalistic approach most of old hollywood epic look like stage play nbraveheart also employ humour at the right place not only to make bloody reality of medieval british isle more bearable to sensitive audience but also to underline it down to earth atmosphere so different from previous historical epic nwhat make braveheart larger than life is his protagonist nmel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and a result character of 15th century poem is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero nwallace is more than superior to his enemy both physically and mentally yet he is able to show his sensitive more vulnerable side nnaturally when the character is based on epic poem most of historical accuracy is going down the drain which wa the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s nhowever even those who don particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel played by sophie marceau and make her child nbecause of that the disbelief is hardly suspended and final scene aren a effective a they should be nmel gibson a an actor is truly wonderful and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actor nmost memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan whose cold calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villain seen in contemporary cinema nbrendan gleeson who would later become famous for his role in boorman general is also very good a wallace trusted companion a well a ian bannen is effective a leprosy stricken king john balliol ndavid harra is very entertaining a wallace irish ally and angus macfadyen brings lot of anxiety into his conscience stricken character of robert the bruce nwomen in this film have rather thankless role especially marceau a one dimensional french princess ncatherine mccormack a wallace wife wa more interesting but she wa eliminated from the picture early on nfrom the technical point of view the film is also very good nphotography by john toll brings lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen non the other hand the musical score by james horner employ too much of modern day instrument for period piece set in medieval time nalthough mostly welcomed by critic and audience alike braveheart wa often criticised for homophobia and other form of extreme conservatism nthe main reason for that wa the fact that gibson among many historical fact chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of longshank son prince edward played by peter hanly nhe is not only presented a villain but also a one of the le competent in villain camp and portraying of homosexual a villain or inferior to heterosexual is almost unforgivable sin in politically correct hollywood nto make thing even more obvious good guy in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward rugged macho men of mountain who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservative common sense instead of fashionable theory of ivory tower liberal nhowever although the message of this film might look right wing it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movement in 20th century naccording to that ideology oppressed class worker peasant are better suited to fight for national freedom because their member ha le to lose in that struggle and a such they are more radical le willing to make compromise and more efficient on the other hand privileged class aristocracy bourgeoisie are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoot with foreign oppressor in order to keep their privilege nthis marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety nin the end whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meaning or simply want to enjoy entertaining historical epic braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fan of this recently resurrected genre',\n",

about his handling of the combative actor nhell no they feel lee is genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie nall of which underscore how billy crystal and co writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise the comedy in america sweetheart is based on barely in control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporter except that it doesn matter because any publicity is good publicity nand thus the very set up for the film implodes leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter nso what about the cast njulia robert at her best playing the underdog is utterly charming here although could have lived without flashback that exist solely a an excuse to show her in fat suit and not very convincing one by the way ncatherine zeta jones make believable brat and john cusack flesh out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic nby casting himself a the publicist billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he doe on comic relief stay on the sideline of the action while tossing off cornball joke and snarky remark nin supporting role hank azaria wear out his welcome fast with broad gesture and spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed too broad nseth green is amusing a toadie stanley tucci is very good a ruthless studio head and christopher walken play the eccentric director with suitable flair though he ha little to work with ncome to think of it little to work with is the operative phrase for this movie na hollywood satire america sweetheart is toothless na romance it is at best minor pleasure nsuch good cast such waste of their effort nhad it not been taken long ago better title for the film would have been much ado about nothing',\n",

the expert of course if there were any movie out worth seeing never mind that our taste couldn be more divergent ll never forget the day she recommended that go see night at the roxbury for god sake and to be fair she wa mightily pissed at me for telling her that go nwas lot of fun which it is so didn see this a anything more than futile attempt at conversation ni muttered with little trepidation that she might enjoy high fidelity nshe responded with her usual query whose in that one nthis is question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see nif the reply is julia robert you probably assume it wa something wispy and light sylvester stallone movie and you picture bloodbath with few word and much involuntary bicep flexing and woody allen movie mean hyper articulate white people usually of the jewish faith fretting about in some upper east side palace nanyway when answered john cusack she replied with rather stunned who a if it wa unreasonable for her to know whom wa referring to nnow know for fact that my mother ha seen several cusack movie most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin but suppose it understandable that she would not recognize the name after all for most name are tougher than face ni showed her picture of cusack mug in the paper hoping for an oh him yes he quite good instead got no don know him nat this point wa way beyond frustration into realm of nose hair yanking anger yes filmic ignorance is all it take to get me into the nose hair pulling zone till realized something doubt that much of america would recognize cusack relatively bland visage or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of brad pitt or tom cruise one syllable name that glide off the tongue with the velocity of speeding car ncu sack cu sack no not quite a cool ni sure that twenty year from now cusack will forever be referred to a the guy from add in the cusack film of your choice nhe not brand name and his movie usually aren big moneymaker but in his own unassuming way he kind of genius nwith his pleasant common man look and charming semi articulate blatherings he ha become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90 nfrom the sure thing to say anything cusack ha merged the talent of early tom hank and early jack lemmon ndespite the fact that nearly every character he play is variation of the character before it the schlumpy every man he a constantly enjoyable screen persona like albert brook or woody allen nand he know how to chose script while the stephan baldwin and val kilmer seem to put them self in everything the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspect with pauly shore vehicle and judging from his latest project it look like he still ha yet to fire his agent cusack generally pick rewarding project save for the unwatchable hot pursuit 1988 film also featuring young ben stiller nhigh fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fear the grifter the hi lo country and it a hit nit wa also co written by cusack and some of his collaborator on the terrific comedy grosse point blank nit not quite a entertaining or a funny a that film but a it progress in it meandering fashion the movie cast something of spell over me nhigh fidelity begin a hipster ode to the non committal rob vinyl record store owner who open the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating u in his top 5 break ups list nthis is something cusack doe the entire film la ferris bueller day off nat first the talking directly into the camera schtick had me vaguely annoyed mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shot which used similar conceit but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack witty delivery nhe the kind of guy we don mind talking directly to u ngradually the film settle into shampoo like tragus comic character study of guy who must confront himself and his personal failure in order to figure out the true person he is yes it all very existential nthough that plot line is mostly enjoyable the thing liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offer in introducing u to minor character all of whom now this is really something are terrific enough to warrant their own film nthe best of which is jack black of the very funny show tenacious a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis hair unfortunately that annoying smirk remains an ardent record store employee who bully customer into buying exactly what he want them to buy nhe the kind of guy m sure we ve all met before blowhard who think he always right and will do anything in his power be it yell argue insult to hoist his opinion onto others nbut like this guy because of how black play him nthe actor is portly with round baby face and crazy eye but despite his size he leap to and fro like manic speed freak which might be bit of redundant description seeing a how all the speed freak know are manic nhe the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other film look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister nbut fear and black never let that happen nthe character for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality nhe over the top but in way we can all probably relate to ncatherine zeta jones in her brief role give vivid portrayal of woman completely enamored with her own charm ntim robbins register in an even tinier part a new age type character played entirely for cartoon yuks but still manages to work it desired comic effect nthe one exception in the acting department is bit of doozy the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle mifune who completely obliterates any trace of danish accent replacing it with stilted american phonation ni give her kudos for attempting such contradictory role but instead of being likeable she come across a rather robotic and a such it hard to see why cusack character would be so obsessed with her especially when he ha beautiful intelligent writer natasha gregson wagner potentially waiting in the wing nthis reminded me of say anything where the charming cusack wa paired with the charmless ione skye and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood whose unbelievably more wooden then father clint for those special people whose wheel turn little slower nin fact cusack is rarely paired up with personality that match his though d bet that if laura and natasha switched role the result would be more effective nhigh fidelity work almost entirely on the strength of it character and performance nfears direction is somewhat stilted and the script is sometimes little too and this is word m beginning to hate to use but ala must quirky for it own good think ll blame that on scott rosenberg who judging from what he did with beautiful girl con air and thing to do in denver while your dead ha his fingerprint all over the most irritating bit of this movie nbut cusack really doe deserve an award for being so damn cusackian ni afraid that his talent are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip need replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent nhis character rob whose sort of like an older more bitter lloyd from say anything is funny and tragic without being pathetic and that cusack can do all this and still not imprint himself onto the mind of most audience is something of an achievement',\n",

is one question to ask in this case doe the film have other virtue that override the existing logical inconsistency nthe terminator film made up for them with exciting action back to the future did it with an entertaining story and the new film frequency pull off the trick with strong package of it own ni frequency filled with plot hole nyes ndoes it matter nnot really nthe film open in october of 1969 nfirefighter frank sullivan dennis quaid put his life on the line every time he suit up for his job then go home to his loving wife julia elizabeth mitchell and son johnny daniel henson nthe double pronged story flash forward to 1999 where johnny now jim caviezel is all grown up and working a police detective na strange occurrence the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in 69 and that john ha found in the present day nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea john eventually take this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in warehouse fire and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom nnow flooded with memory of full life with his father alive john is initially overjoyed until he discovers that the change to the timeline have been disastrous serial killer that would have died ha instead lived to kill seven more woman nfrank and john now must work together to set thing right with john using the information he ha gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past nthe premise of frequency is unusual and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept john and frank are the only one conscious of how the timeline ha been changed a result of their action nthis isn explained you just have to go with it nwhen frank doesn die in fire john is the only one who remembers it differently while everyone else remembers it the new way nthe concept also run into problem concerning just how synchronous the two reality 1969 and 1999 are to each other nsometimes frank changing the past result in something happening right away in john world and sometimes john get the change ahead of time nnow the filmmaker might have perfectly good explanation for this and could probably come up with something fairly convoluted but nevertheless logical if thought about it hard enough for example the reason john get advance information of the serial killer murder wa because the change had already happened in frank world and john is only witnessing the projection of that change but explanation aren really the point nwhen frequency get cooking it a riveting little thriller even if it is confusing nwhat matter to film like this is if the plot make sense in the moment and frequency work a long a it keep moving nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure frequency a good hollywood entertainment establishing decent likable character making u care for them and setting up goal to be reached and conflict to be resolved ni liked many of the creative touch the split screen allowing u to see how the universe is being affected in both reality and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward nit actually us the 1969 mets oriole world series the one that featured the amazin mets to great effect frank us john advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friend to believe him admittedly this device may only be of interest to baseball fan like myself ni even liked the final scene which feature frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time period nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing a the reality shift start coming fast and furious but it doe make sense if you think about it and give the script lot of leeway and let face it it a darn cool way to end the film nthere are enough surprise and plot twist in frequency to keep you on your toe and a result the movie avoids growing stagnant nthe other major thing to appreciate about frequency is the handling of the father son relationship nquaid and caviezel carry off their part easily it a rock solid job from both actor nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept how would one react to being able to communicate with dead relative or with future descendant nwatching the exchange between frank and john will give you pretty good idea of how to answer that question nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film if we don believe in the character we don care about the outcome of the thriller plot nhere we do care because we like the lead actor ni also liked some of the supporting cast member nelizabeth mitchell get stuck with two thankless role playing julia the doting wife and mother but still performs admirably nandre braugher late of the television show homicide life on the street give nice supporting turn a frank best friend and future colleague of john nhe ha lovely scene in diner in which he try to explain the situation to julia while frank world series prediction come true before his very eye nbraugher strike the perfect facial expression here simultaneously dismayed and amused nperhaps the only thing didn like about frequency is the overly sentimental coda during which the camera focus go little too soft and the baseball theme get carried overboard nbut that only because the film had already earned poignancy without resorting to cheap tactic ni freely acknowledge that frequency may best work a guy movie since it focus on the very male oriented idea of father son relationship echo of field of dream can be easily heard but the underlying concept is universally applicable nwho wouldn want to speak with long dead parent nor see how their child turn out tell me about your life son excuse me while mist up nand don call me sissy',\n",

would be even more severe because that film is very special for ten of million if not hundred of million of fan nin any case objectivity is something seldom seen in star war review because undisputed majority of reviewer rate it a one of the best if not the best film of all time nthose who don usually have some difficulty in hiding their artistic snobbery nthe author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold objective standard in reviewing this film nlike so many previous reviewer must note that watched star war for the first time twenty year ago and that remained enchanted by the experience ever since nperhaps it wa childlike fascination with until then unimaginable wonder that happened long time ago in galaxy far away nor perhaps it wa the rush felt minute before the opening shot with my expectation already pumped up by serialised comic book and novelisation had read before nanyway watching of star war wa one of the most important movie going experience of my life nand it wa also unmatched for many year to come because very few movie managed to have such strong impact on me like george lucas epic nstar war wasn just important movie for me or the million of fan who probably share the same sentiment nit wa the defining moment in the history of modern cinema nuntil than american motion picture industry wa in limbo social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood and new author filled the void mostly by using hollywood financial and technical resource to create serious personal or artsy movie na result audience traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate didn want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen ngeorge lucas with it science fiction epic wa among the first to come into rescue nthe audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm and huge financial success of the movie later backed by supplement industry of toy book comic role playing game and other merchandise slowly began to change the face of hollywood nserious adult movie with artistic ambition faded into oblivion and were replaced by industrial product of blockbuster philosophy none of the biggest casualty of that trend wa the science fiction movie genre nuntil 1977 science fiction movie were mostly in production domain nin late 1960s bigger budget for science fiction didn look so strange anymore thanks to the great success of 2001 space odyssey nbut the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism and hollywood science fiction wa a bleak a the rest of it production mostly dark dystopic movie nhowever in 1977 star war showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movie even among the audience that usually doesn like it na result seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away although some good dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s nafter that science fiction continued to be considered synonym for family entertainment nironically the man responsible for star war wa in it time considered to be member of new hollywood generation of young movie author who made artsy and personal film in early 1970s ngeorge lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 and nostalgic drama american graffiti nboth movie were considered personal in it time despite latter one becoming very popular nin sense star war is an also very personal film and the thorny way to the final production show that commercial consideration were against it not for it nbut unlike many personal movie of the era it personality wa in line with the wish of the general audience nthe plot set long time ago in galaxy far away begin in time of civil war nthe evil empire is threatened by rebel who want to restore the old republic nin order to quash any opposition the empire had built death star superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planet nthe information about death star acquired by rebel intelligence is being transported by princess leia organon carrie fisher when her ship get intercepted by imperial cruiser nprincess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robot c3po anthony daniel and r2d2 kenny baker nthose two robot are sold to the family of luke skywalker mark hamill young restless man who want to leave his farm and become space pilot nhis adventure begin when r2d2 escape because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi alec guiness nold man is actually the last surviving jedi knight member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force nafter some hesitation luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess while the old man would teach him the way of the force ntheir small band come to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo harrison ford and his furry sidekick chewbacca peter mayhew ncritics who don like the movie especially those who can forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of new hollywood are prone to point the lack of originality non the surface they might be right lucas himself admits that he found lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood western wwii aviation movie old sf cliffhanger serial of the 1930s and 1940s yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa samurai classic the hidden fortress non the other hand those who had spent last two decade studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star war went even further into collective subconscious of western civilisation hinted by some mild tolkien reference nthe others would find the author element within the story star war could be seen a an anti establishment film young long haired easy going nature loving hero are fighting against old uptight and oppressive force who use supertechnology in most demonic purpose neven out of it historical or social context star war is an impressive a strictly technical piece of the seven art ngeorge lucas direction is very good with the clever editing and well paced segment between action and dramatic buildup ncharacters are well drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredient both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster nwe have coming of age hero damsel in distress somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trend of the time reluctant helper benevolent mentor diabolical villain and finally comic relief in form of two non human character nsome of the actor are very good alec guiness in his most famous role to date james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease peter cushing a an incarnation of pure evil in human form nunfortunately the same can be said for the main lead among the main trio of mark hamill carrie fisher and harrison ford only the last one had the character three dimensional enough to launch his further acting career nthe thing that looked like the most important segment of star war phenomenon during it initial release wa the new level of special effect technology noften comparison with 2001 space odyssey another ground breaking sf film were citing the sheer number of effect a proof of the lucas superiority over kubrick nhowever the special effect by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive even after two decade although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly yet they aren the most remembered trademark of the movie nthat honour should definitely go to the oscar winning soundtrack by john williams whose work on star war is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career nnewer generation of viewer might be somewhat

       " '54 is dull perfunctory uninspired and boring na greater writer might have created lyrical sentence for each of those adjective flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphor ni however would rather cut to the chase n54 is dull perfunctory uninspired and boring nthere is nothing in it not glimpse of depth nor shimmer of intelligence or insight nthere is no electricity in any of the scene or moment of interest in the story or it subplots nand it underdeveloped and feature an array of bland character played by actor who think they re in this year boogie night nthey are so wrong nthe picture ha been assembled by mark christopher nbased on this film don know how he got job in the business n54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name which originated in the 70 and closed down in the 80 ni don know if this film went into production after boogie night wa released but christopher ha managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson brilliant work in every possible way from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography nwhat it lack is everything that made boogie night great depth intelligence energy fascinating character and challenging theme n54 can even measure up to the last day of disco which is flawed but still smart and entertaining nit remarkably bad timing d say to release film this tedious after couple of noteworthy picture of the same kind ni have exaggerated though there is one interesting character and one terrific performance nthat character is steve rubell played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves nsteve rubell is the owner of studio 54 and if christopher had focused on him then myers could have forced good film out of this wreck all by himself nalas we are instead guided to endure the trial of young man named shane ryan phillippe going nowhere new jersey teen who get job in the club thanks to rubell homosexual impulse nit here that he meet his friend the array of uninteresting character his co worker greg brecklin meyer his wife anita salma hayek and of course the love interest julie black neve campbell nshane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning and he ha reasonably sturdy home life some of the scene with his father border on interesting while heather matarazzo who play his sister push phillippe off the screen nbut he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene and succumb to peer pressure and to drug nwhy his friend push him into drug is never really explained but the fact that they are friend is questioned only is superficial way greg get really mad at shane because he been elevated to bartender status nthere isn a single conflict that take center stage except that shane ha some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he work nmost of the film is dumb and most of the dialogue is inane nthere a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black and in the next scene they re arm in arm without bit of development nthen they re kissing in bowling alley nthis is five minute of material thrown into the picture at the last minute well past the one hour mark and this isn a long film to begin with ncampbell is talented actress but she need role that give her little depth nthis one doesn nand phillippe ha almost no presence whatsoever this performance pale in comparison to mark whalberg star making role in boogie night nhe seems dumb and misguided and his voice never change tone ni guess he wa picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body but he seems pretty lanky to me nhe all wrong for lead role but it doesn help that christopher ha forgotten to develop his character nby the end of 54 shane most notable trait is his stupid fake accent nthe rest of the performance are wasted nhayek is an energetic talented young actress and doe almost nothing here nmeyer is endearing but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard nonly myers by sheer force of talent manages to rise above christopher wading pool of script nrubell ha been written just a depthless a the rest of the character but myers is good enough to inject subtlety that help round out the performance nin fact myers is the sole reason to see 54 and all it really doe is make you wish that the film had revolved around him ni ve read that studio 54 ha been recreated down to the last detail nfrankly don care nit easy to recreate something technical like this na fairly skilled production designer and few carpenter can manage such task nbesides christopher keep the light so low that the set are invisible anyway naside from myers performance 54 is complete failure nit dull perfunctory uninspired and boring nsome may find my comparison to boogie night unfair but they re so obvious to me nin any event 54 is pallid without the contrast nit doesn even work a mindless entertainment it so shallow that the most escapist viewer are likely to dismiss it nso don forget those key word dull perfunctory uninspired and boring neverything else said wa just padding',\n",

       " 'capsule the much anticipated re adaptation of the pierre boulle novel come to the screen a dark and little dreary film with lot of chase and fighting but very little intelligence nvisually there is much to like about this version but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver travel and treat it a an action film nthat make it film without much center 0 4 to 4 npierre boulle author of the bridge on the river kwai wrote planet of the ape k monkey planet the novel a social satire nit read lot like fifth book of gulliver travel nhumans discover planet in which the role of ape and human have been reversed not unlike the role of horse and human on jonathan swift island of the houyhnhnm nthe novel move somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the thing most film fan know to be true about the nature of the planet nit seems to me there is also statement about human cruelty to animal but perhaps wa just looking for that nwhen rod serling adapted the novel into film released in 1968 he added number of serling touch familiar from episode of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling ish nthe final irony of the original version ha become film history nwithout it there could never have been planet of the ape film series ni can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problem in how to handle the tricky question of language nin the book the ape had their own language and the human eventually learned that language nthat could have been done in the film but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non ape speaking nserling avoided this by having the ape speak english and of course there is some justification for that by the end of the film njustifying why the ape spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending nbut serling never tackle the all important question of why supposedly intelligent human never show any curiosity or even surprise that the ape speak his own language language they had no opportunity to ever hear nfew viewer questioned this serious plot hole however and the film ha become well respected in cinema history npartial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith best if not his best nwhen the film success called for sequel the filmmaker turned up the violence and they added well intentioned though not very subtle political message about what wa happening in the united state of the 1960s and 1970s nwhile the first film had little shooting of gun and what wa there seemed little half hearted by the second film beneath the planet of the ape there wa good deal more violence and from that point on the series had lot of violence and chase nthe series concluded with battle for the planet of the ape in 1973 nnow director tim burton try his hand at adapting the original book again nfor those who thought that the 1968 version wa not very faithful to the book burton new version is even le faithful nfirst he doe not really reverse the role of the human and the ape nhe ha them both be intelligent articulate race battling for dominance of the planet currently in the hand uh make that paw of the ape nthat could be good story too but it is not planet of the ape na with the mission impossible film and so many other cinematic homage to the third quarter of the last century the title make promise that the filmmaker have no intention of honoring nin 2029 leo davidson mark wahlberg not this world most expressive actor work on space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of ape nthen convenient time storm sweep him up wizard of oz fashion and drop him on an alien planet yes he survives this storm but then no storm is perfect nhe quickly find not greatly to any surprise he show that on this planet ape rule and human drool but everybody talk nand the language they talk is earth english napparently it doe not even occur to leo that there is mystery that need to be explained about that nthe fact it doe not occur to leo and apparently didn occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film nboth just assumed that if ape were going to talk the language they would speak would be english nin any case having one talking race dominating another make this not look at human animal relationship and more one of the master slave relationship noutside of sudan and few other country this is le relevant topic nleo is captured to be used a slave but also is discovered by ari played by helena bonham carter nari is an attractive ape with close tie to high political power nshe is bent on making the world better place nperhaps in previous draft of the script she wa called hil ari nin any case with makeup that stifle her usual pout carter is just about a attractive a she ha ever been in film nshe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward nit is not long before leo escape with some human and only couple of sympathetic ape nthis is further abandonment of the source material nthe chase severely limit the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each place in this reversed society each important in the book nwe cannot see how the society work because most of the screentime society ha broken down nwe see the human either separated from the ape or fighting them nburton chooses visceral thrill over cerebral one at almost every turn nthis is miscalculation a character so lacking in empathy value are difficult one to place much emotional investment in nthey are basically chess piece and the viewer ha little reason to root for them to win nthe 1968 script had little subtlety with line like never met an ape didn like but at least we cared for what happened to taylor the main character nmost of what this film ha to offer is in the visuals nthe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film take place in the night or in fog nthis tends to limit close look at the makeup nin general it seems much improved from 1968 nthe makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chamber who did it for the 1968 version nin 1968 chamber makeup wa jaw dropper nit wa realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion nchambers is good but if anyone had chance to best him it would have to be baker ntoday audience have higher expectation baker visualization is really an improvement nthese visuals work nicely nwhat doe not work is the wire assisted leap some of the ape make nthey look like they were inspired by the physic defying leap of crouching tiger hidden dragon nape spring incredible distance nsome of the best scene are ape running into battle looking like they have ape posture but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost none final visual problem is that the film frequently show it budget in what should be spectacular battle scene the camera show u only small group of people close up nsince the day of lon chaney and boris karloff few actor have crossed over to stardom in role that required heavy make up nthe one actor who ha shot is paul giamatti nit is not that his line are so good most are silly joke nbut he delivers them very well nhe wa always watchable actor but ha not yet made stardom na the ape trader limbo he over emotes to overcome his ape make up but doe it very well nin doing so he make himself the most interesting thing on the screen nhe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memory of peter ustinov performance in spartacus na an in joke there are several line in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself ndanny elfman score ha nice primitive feel but jerry goldsmith 1968 tour de force score is real classic nthat score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten ni rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the 4 to 4 scale',\n",

under the spell of the powerful first hour nafter subsequent viewing feel that independence day really wasn a great a it seemed though still give it positive review nstarship trooper on the other hand ha mocking sense of humor knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem na result starship trooper is more exciting energetic and lively science fiction film nin fact probably could never get tired of watching this film nstarship trooper is very reminiscient of star war another kick as space opera which reinvented the sci fi drama altogether nwhile starship trooper is no star war it come quite close and the easiest assessment would be to call this film the star war of the 90 nam being to generous to this film nperhaps but when science fiction film come along that can mix humor and romance effectively into the warring race nin essence this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction nthe easiest way to write review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction film and may have to nstarship trooper is not quite an original film persay but director paul verhoeven give the film kick the alien ass style nid4 had this same style except it wa forced most likely the cause of will smith having major role nthis new star war ha very simple basic plot mankind v an alien specie nthe alien specie in question here is the bug seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid type insect nhowever the underlying moral of starship trooper are fleshed out with deadly accuracy nsometimes the moral are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scene but during quiet moment we realize that starship trooper ha something to tell u about our civilization nmore than likely these moral will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie end nand they should be ni doubt verhoeven intended this film to be thought provoking film nthis is an event film but surprisingly above average nit is extremely refreshing to watch sci fi war film and actually root for the human side something independence day never achieved nstarship trooper begin with satirical portrayal of those strange join the army ad nmixing web based interface these summation of event are refreshingly original nstating would you like to know more nthese short news bulletin give the film an immediate sense of humor and we know we should not take it seriously nhowever we also witness the murder of several trooper in battle in gory yet funny way nafter witnessing the slaughter the film jump back one year to setup what we just saw nwe are introduced to johnny rico casper van dien and carmen ibanez denise richards nrico flirt with carmen by sending her message over computer terminal in school classroom nhowever carmen isn a interested in rico a she is in becoming pilot nhowever another classmate dizzy flores dina meyer ha her eye on rico nunfortunately rico isn interested in dizzy nthis setup is rather cliched a is the result of the setup but it still is fun to watch ncarmen sign up to become starship trooper and a result rico sign up nand a result dizzy sign up neveryone is assigned certain position in the academy carmen get the pilot position she wanted carl jenkins neil patrick harris psychic get position in the training program and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship trooper the mobile infantry nthe main story follows rico through his trial and relationship nin reality found myself watching space version of melrose place but with better special effect nan hour into the film the war begin na sense of tension grew in the audience watched this film with nthe first hour may have been funny sometimes unintentionally setup but we grew to care for the flat character because no matter how hard tried not to like the character their gorgeous look won me over call me superficial if you must nfollowing the training session which had many drama in themselves too many to mention here the trooper are sent to war nthe bug live on the planet klendathu planet which consists of dirt and rock and pretty much nothing else nmany drama occur during the war until finally the trooper realize that their is something behind the bug attack na sort of intelligence which mastermind the defense nthe trooper are ordered to locate the brain and capture it ni hopefully left the plot a vague a possible because starship trooper is not about plot nit about special effect and gory violence ndirector verhoeven most known for his nudie film showgirl and basic instinct return to his sci fi day which gave u good film like total recall nverhoeven like to push the envelope of the mpaa but despite all the violence the comic book feel give the film sense of falsehood nstarship trooper is extremely violent with more gore than this year event horizon nthe rating is well deserved and hopefully parent will not allow their 12 year old child to see it nmy guess is that verhoeven target audience is the 18 to 25 male group nthe film ha testosterone level off the chart with chiseled men and beautiful woman ndespite these superficial element starship trooper also creates world which made star war so successful nwhile watching the film we never second guess the character decision because they seem perfectly clear nthankfully no hero is punching alien in the face which give the flat character some depth for which we can identify with nthe cast of starship trooper is quite annoying to begin with but they soon grow on you ncasper van dien ha the chiseled facial feature and tan skin which will make most girl swoon nto most guy he will come across a artificial nfortunately van dien is the worst of the cast despite how hard he try to come off a real character ndina meyer doe much better job of fleshing out her character nher dizzy is extremely likeable ndenise richards also doe good job and her scene are very well done njake busey gary busey son give wonderfully funny performance and provides one of the biggest laugh of the film nneil patrick harris remember he wa doogie howser is little wooden and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast nhowever he doe give good performance nmichael ironside give the best performance of the film a the teacher with one arm nhis performance rise above the rest nperhaps it is because his character is the most developed but think it is just ironside presence on screen nunfortunately no particular cast member give star making performance which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast member star ndirector verhoeven is the main star of the film nhis direction is fast and unrelentless nhe never slows down his pace which make for wild ride nwriter edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein nthe writing is usually very funny and sometimes very corny nthe dialogue is smart but not too smart nwe aren required to know everything but some plot hole are left unanswered nthankfully we are not intended to notice and we really don except for one which lingered in my mind for quite while namazingly with all the war and romance going on the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issue nin fact these governmental change seem fairly plausible and this add another layer to the story nthe moral debate of the character is quite surprising to find in film of this genre but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage ni haven laughed this loud even in some comedy noh and the special effect are first rate nstarship trooper is rated for graphic sci fi violence and gore and for some language and nudity nbelieve me when say this don take young kid to see this film nit is extremely violent nin fact it is probably the most violent film out this year nhowever if you are old enough over 17 to see it starship trooper is guaranteed to entertain nit been long time since have cheered for the hero while also cheering for the bad guy nand still it is my dream to see sci fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind and take over the world nnow that would be entertaining',\n",
       " 'm an avid fan of the alien saga so this review is obviously tad biased at least admitted it nof course that doesn mean that m gonna be giving this four star review or something because alien resurrection the fourth film in the cool a hell series is not an absolutely amazing film much like the first two were nhowever it a very good film which never fails to entertain and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series nin short had good time alien resurrection leaf off 200 year after the last one where our heroine protagonist ellen ripley sigourney weaver the science fiction genre answer to job had killed herself after discovering that an alien wa inside her body waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one nof course the last one wasn very great or anything liked it though not a much a the first two and more importantly it wasn financially successful tawdry 55 million buck nso back we are with ripley back a clone which mean we get another little satirical look at cloning not that that a bad thing but it becoming cliche nso she cloned aboard an even more futuristic looking ship called the auriga by some doctor including the necessary bad government guy dr wren played by e freeman a well a the little seen dr gediman played by none other than brad douriff mainly because they have version of her with the alien still inside her nonce you get past the fact that you can figure out where they got her blood although think it might have been from the blood sample taken by charles dance in the third one the film okay nalso on board are band of mercenary pirate including michael wincott ron perlman kim flower raymond cruz dominique pinon jeunet sytable and winona ryder who play analee call who turn out to have bit of secret won state it but unless you ve been shacking up with salinger for the past two year you probably know all about it although it nicely covered up nthere a bit of non sexual yet slightly homoerotic relationship between her and ripley but it never really deepened enough noh well nwell a you might have guessed the alien and it spawn escape and run around the ship nand it pretty much doe away with most of the people on the ship including some shock dan hedaya for instance who death is comical yet sad since well he dan hedaya and the remaining people about 7 or 8 are left to try and escape and stop the alien from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth nof course the plot is all balderdash and just an excuse for some good old alien brand fun nthe real focus of the series seems to be on style not really substance although there always bit of it most notably in alien with the relationship between ripley and the little girl nwhat interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in it approach alien is claustrophobic exercise in quiet fright alien is wild tense thriller alien 3 is bleak moody piece of semi noir alien 4 is kind of like an off beat french film filled with lot of humor and cool scare njean pierre jeunet without his usual directing partner marc caro creates ship filled with the kind of scare film like da boot ha with echo hinting at possible threat nthe chill in the film are really cool especially with the music which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scene there the most tense surgery scene since face off towards the beginning nand not every chill turn into bloody mess or anything like that nthis all combined with some good old humor make this a interesting visually and stylistically a the others nthere are even couple scene which just stick out afterwards a being brilliantly executed none is the aforementioned surgery scene nanother one take place between call and ripley which is just awesome nthe underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense thrilling and jaw dropping scene in the entire saga with small allusion to jeunet earlier film delicatessen nand the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool with lovely allusion to goldfinger nbut the best scene in the entire film m sure m not the first to mention it take place when ripley see all the variation on her a they cloned her she ha an 8 tatooed on her arm nit might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga nthe screenplay by joss whedon is not great piece of work a it never really deapens lot of the character nhowever it doe make u care about most of them so that when there very little of them and it look like one or more of them may become alien chow we are pretty scared nand yeah there are some very funny line ripley who do have to fuck to get off this boat njohner well can get you off nbut not this ship nthe acting is good all around with stand out performance from ron perlman a the male chauvenist pig johner and leland orser the poor bastad in se7en who performed the lust sin a an anxiety ridden wannabe woody allen who ha an alien inside him nwinona ryder is good but not amazing like she usually is although she mesh well with the film nof course and a usual sigourney weaver steal the show nplaying variation on the ripley character le emotional and more rude and bitter she pull it off while still being utterly lovable nshe not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for alien but she just awesome noverall it a thrilling entertaining film which doesn really amaze like the first two but is much more amazing than the third installment nthe style is the best part of the film which isn really bad thing but it being the best part take away from lot of the depth the film occasionally try to apply nbut it entertaining a hell and it definitely fit for the alien series',\n",

       " 'set in the late 80 at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton elli who explored the same theme in another book which wa also made into movie le than zero american psycho put new spin on the yuppie genre that elli helped to create nchristian bale is perfectly cast a patrick bateman high powered yuppie who hide terrible secret from his fianc and his colleague nit seems that bateman is serial killer and unfortunately for his contemporary his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip na he try to balance his meticulous daily routine with slaughtering co worker and prostitute and hiding their body his mental fabric slowly begin to unravel ni wa first introduced to the novel when wa still in high school ni read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problem elli wa having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it na usual when anything is controversial try to seek it out but soon forgot about the novel and didn end up thinking about it again until stumbled across it couple of year later at bookstore ni picked it up and read it but wa ultimately disappointed because it left more question than answer nthe movie ha similar effect but at least it le cryptic than elli novel nfor once film ha actually turned out to be better than the novel it wa based on nboth the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparation down to exactly what facial scrub and exfoliating cream he us but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excess throughout nthe movie continues to touch upon these thing but make more of point to immerse u in bateman impending madness than to detail thing a painstakingly a the novel doe na result the film is immensely more entertaining nlions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial film having picked up kevin smith catholic rattling dogma and here with american psycho there is no difference nscreenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take novel about yuppie filled with graphic violence and sex and make marketable film out of it nsome cut had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc 17 mainly involving sex scene comprising bateman and two woman and initial report said the film wa unwatchable nthankfully it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical film this side of south park bigger longer uncut nside note 1 co writer guinevere turner also make an appearance in the film a an ill fated acquaintance of bateman who after bateman suggests that she start making out with female prostitute proclaims that she not lesbian nor ha any interest in it nthe ironic humor of the scene stem from the fact that turner the writer director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with part of his script for chasing amy is lesbian nit a subtle in joke and it one found to be pretty humorous ndespite having rather high profile supporting cast of young up and comer including reese witherspoon most of the role are waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameo nthe real draw here is christian bale and his over the top performance a patrick bateman nwhenever read novel always try to imagine what it would be like a movie and who would be perfect to cast a the character ni always had hard time trying to decide who would cast a bateman but never thought bale would deliver performance a perfect a his end up being nto say bale run away with the character is vast understatement and he prof that he a adept at chewing scenery a al pacino or rod steiger none sequence in particular involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news song hip to be square right before burying an axe in co worker head feature one of the most eccentric and kinetic performance have ever seen on film nside note 2 despite the fact that huey lewis hip to be square and pair of phil collins song appear in the film don expect to see them on the soundtrack release nhuey lewis expressly requested that his song featured in rather large set piece in the film much akin to the use of stuck in the middle with you in reservoir dog not be included on any soundtrack release ni assuming that collins requested the same non similar note whitney houston cover of the greatest love of all is also involved in scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source napparently houston wasn a open about the use of her song a the others were na bigger controversy than the violence and sex ha been brewing since the film release that of whether or not patrick ha actually committed the crime we have viewed during the course of the film ndon look to the book for any answer because it will only serve to confuse you more nseveral web site have been dedicated to the subject but m still undecided nthere is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against come from scene near the end of the film where bateman go on killing spree taking out cop old lady and cleaning staff with equal gusto nthe scene seemed very dream like and a absurd a the action film it suddenly seems to be parodying a an example bateman blow up police car very cinematically after firing several shot from handgun in the general direction of the car ni kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there but bateman never doe wake up and the whole sequence though comic throw the film off balance which suppose wa the intention nother than the few flaw have mentioned american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what ha just transpired actually occurred in bateman reality ni think this movie is destined for greatness a cult film and deserves the spot it will take a such nit may not change anyone life but it will certainly have an effect ni know will certainly hear hip to be square in different context the next time hear it r',\n",

about getting it is by talking to internal affair who then convince him to go undercover a double agent nhe doe so with one condition he will not rat on his partner nright away we know that that is

the movie is how he lay back and let the camera soak up the action nhis scene transition rapidly from one to the next building layer of tension and he rarely hold for reaction shot instead he click away at precisely the moment character stop yakking nlumet worst tendency is one that many film maker especially oliver stone tend to overuse he relies little too heavily on actor shouting their line

is to make these kind of picture even tolerable nof course cop movie aren popular anymore yes buddy cop flick are popular but those are more like extended sitcom with gunfire amid the punch line but just look at the average hollywood action movie flick so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serf no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn gay the lame comic relief character who never funny and on and on nfor all it moral ambiguity prince of the city is back to the basic cop courtroom drama that leaf out all the crap and really

ia officer and look a if he about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speech but instead he break down in front of the cop and begin sobbing nthis is scene that would never make it into michael bay film even though bruce willis sacrifice his life at the end of armageddon not one damn tear it would be cut out because the director would say oh that make him too human excuse me

       " 'note some may consider portion of the following text to be spoiler nbe forewarned nat the end of the day those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avenger would do well to take note that warning cloud loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screening and scrapped plan for gala premiere nthis highly anticipated film rendition of the cult television show wa originally slotted for an early june opening where it would have gone head to head against the rival studio heavy hitter it eventual demotion to le potent mid august opening wa an obvious early indication of the studio lack of confidence with the picture nand with good reason nthis is joyless exercise of film held together by barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement thrill or wit nremarkable in it banality and brutally uninvolving the avenger is catastrophic mess which immediately invite comparison to last year case study in style over substance joel schumacher much loathed batman robin indeed both film even feature appalling ridiculous sequence which find central character dressed up in fuzzy oversized costume numa thurman who take on the salacious role of the catsuit clad karate chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg wa the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster imbuing her poison ivy with dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audience something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage nunfortunately the same can be said here where she and cohort ralph fiennes our new john steed taking over for patrick macnee demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever fatally crippling the picture a they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actor painfully aware that they re on board sinking ship nat this rate usually splendid actor mr fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man his tepid turn here will make a much of an inroad a his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange day nthe duo look the part and admittedly the avenger is more than most heavily dependent upon style but they re no fun to watch and found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic character a they navigated through the picture caper esque plot nwhen not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmaker chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma a our mr peel no not kate beckinsale although the notion now intrigue me but gwyneth paltrow who wa originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle spot on english accent nif nothing else it at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt nthe story such a it is involves the ever bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter sean connery an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate controlling contraption they also sip lot of tea noverlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonist superior it sound far better than it play and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post production tinkering it clearly evident that the picture ha been cut to shred nthe avenger wa never about gripping drama and our hero accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac it all decidedly uncompelling nmr connery who onscreen barely long enough to register an impression approach the role like man fulfilling contractual obligation simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest nat least it all look good nthis is genuinely handsome production with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt nin particular the gleaming production design by stuart craig command attention adeptly drawing element both old and new in order to depict this great britain nthere are handful of striking visual moment in the film including an attack by swarm of giant robotic bee and nice shot of steed and peel finding way to walk on water but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instance fail to stir interest or raise pulse rate nby the time the film climax had arrived my interest wa not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing wave and thundering rain but with the quickest escape route from the theatre nnot coincidentally the enticing bit of visual bravura were the shot assembled into the movie remarkable trailer savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself the first promo which made the round in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year nit everything that the avenger is not saucy clever engaging and entertaining na crushing disappointment the film is one of the worst outing of the year too drearily awful to be savoured a gleefully bad too polished to overlook it deficiency nthere may be upcoming picture that are even more lifeless than the avenger but sure

down that slippery slope risking his relationship education and reputation a playing poker again becomes the focus of his life nto make film about gambling filmmaker will usually have to play up the

in his mouth nrounders however seems to go more for the latter than the former nthe card club mike and worm frequent aren very glamorous at all nthere a basement lodge with elk head on the wall goulash joint these are the kind of locale in which director john dahl set his shot nexcept for one brief instance when the two player visit atlantic city the film is bereft of the flashing light of the casino or the pleasant color of the green felt table nthe reason rounder still capture our attention is because it is le about the game of poker than it is about the personality which enjoy and are slave to it nwe re given nice set of interesting character with clear motivation and good actor to play them nmatt damon is very natural a mike who struggle between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school and answering what may be his true calling playing professional poker ned norton worm is truly worm always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they re worth njohn turturro who amazes me with his acting range tone it down in this film by playing joey knish virtual poker prodigy in his time who now play the underground game to make rent and child support payment nhe both friend and mentor to mike and turturro low key performance is totally convincing just a john malkovich heavily accented teddy kgb is imposing a an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself nmartin landau is also thrown into the mix a one of mike law professor abe petrovsky nwhile landau slip well into the role his character spitting out personal anecdote about staying true to one self facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward predictable ending nperhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line up of acting talent however is gretchen mol who just didn seem to have much presence on screen nshe a genuine peach to look at kind of cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel and wouldn be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world but her delivered line seemed very flat and found myself looking for matt damon reaction instead na good thing about rounder is that it doesn get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can find time for humor nthe film is peppered nicely with scene that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going such a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next in widely different locale none game in cigar club had me in stitch i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper say one of the player clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the card in his other ni wa hoping mike and worm would really take these guy nwith all the poker being played rounder had the potential to be very confusing nyou might think you know lot about poker but think again nluckily we re given narration by damon during the more intricate moment to explain what going on nthe narration are more informative than intrusive and apprise u of what the stake are and why certain player want to do the thing they do nit nice that a the character develop so doe our comprehension of their world na film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker rounder delivers in spade nwait na film about the culture of

       " 'mercury rising ha numerous flaw but there is one that really stand out it central plot device is unnecessary nthat right nthe major aspect of the film that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy action flick could be dropped from the beginning and the movie would turn out exactly the same if not better nthis central device is the fact that nine year old boy is autistic nhis name is simon and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow alec baldwin want him dead because he unknowingly cracked supersecret government code slipped into the back of puzzle magazine by it programmer just to see if someone could beat it nsimon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film and we are supposed to feel for him because he is poor handicapped child thrown into violent unfair world against his will with only renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him nthe fact that he is autistic doe nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessity of mercury rising ni suppose the original novel upon which the movie wa based did much more with this aspect of simon character and his relationship with willis but here it is lost nmiko hughes the young actor who play simon go through the prescribed motion of being autistic he walk slowly drawl his word kick and scream when he touched and ha hard time looking at other people nit a difficult role for an adult much le young child to play and unfortunately hughes never convinces u that he isn playing like he autistic nunlike dustin hoffman performance in rain man or leonardo dicaprio in what eating gilbert grape we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting nhowever unlike rain man which used it character autism in unique and interesting way to build credible and touching story mercury rising could go right about it generic predictable plot with simon being simply really smart but really shy kid nhell he doesn even have to be shy nin fact the movie might have been more interesting if he had had more active role rather than just being carted around under willis arm nwillis character art jeffries is disillusioned fbi agent who ha been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial task like listening to wiretap with rookie who are happy to be doing anything nhe becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out murder scene at simon house where his father ha apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide nof course we know that isn the way it happened happen because we saw an evil square jawed government hitman with mean looking crew cut knock off the parent nsimon wa able to get away and jeffries find him hiding in secret compartment in closet which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked njeffries who is accused by several character at different time of being paranoid although his action never suggest it know there is something more and he make it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon nthis is quite task because that same hitman who knocked off simon parent is crawling everywhere attempting to kill simon at the hospital on the highway and every other place he go nlate in the movie jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of pretty young woman named stacey kim dickens who he meet at coffee shop nof all the hard to believe aspect of the movie this is the worst ni can believe in the decency of the human heart but stacey character is far too accommodating nnot only doe she agree to watch simon while jeffries run off to solve the mystery she let him into her apartment at two clock in the morning when she know the police is after him and then let him leave simon in her apartment which mean that she ha to forgo business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent nthe grinding squeal of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point nthe movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequence but even here mercury rising doesn rise to the challenge nthe movie wa directed by harold becker who ha made some good suspense film including sea of love 1989 and malice 1993 but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion nthere is one fight on streetcar between jeffries and another hitman played by peter stormare that is so ineptly directed shot and edited that had no idea 1 exactly where they were on the streetcar 2 who wa hitting who and 3 where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were nthe grand finale take place on the roof of tall building and feature harrowing yawn scene where simon walk along the very edge of the building not because he ha to but because it more suspenseful that way ntaken a whole mercury rising is an tepid confused movie that lack style wit and any trace of sense of humor nusually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his role but here he is too straight and serious nthis is because the movie want to be an action flick and heartfelt drama at the same time but it end up failing on both front nmaybe the book wa better but the way it handled here is perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore',\n",

little cake which are supposed to be scale model for his big birthday cake nthe daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he like nhopkins frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair doe what any man in his position would do he punt nwhichever one you like dear he say nand the daughter doe exactly what any woman in her position would do she cry ni liked that scene for two reason nfirst the cake looked really cool nsecond it wa perhaps the only scene in the movie where people acted a you would expect people to act nmeet joe black is chock full of odd performance people doing thing for no discernible reason at all and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hour to boot nit easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial home and the beauteous claire forlani but it even easier to sleep right through it two people on my row managed it quite nicely nthe difficult part of the movie is understanding the character and their motivation and why someone thought three hour wa an appropriate length for this overwrought mess ni know my audience had problem with the movie because they thought it wa comedy ncase in point everyone should know by now that brad pitt play the angel of death in this movie nhowever the first we see of him is a young lawyer in coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani it not clear from the movie whether you need law degree to become the angel of death but it make certain kind of sense nit shouldn take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad thing are about to happen to mr pitt nand indeed they do after hideously prolonged sequence where pitt look over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani look over her shoulder at the retreating pitt because pitt walk into the road without looking and suddenly get squished nwell when that happened the audience howled with laughter and continued to laugh at every comment that wa remotely humorous nso if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing room humor are funny encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately nanyway the deceased lawyer body no worse the wear from it massive injury is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt take over that role nthe idea is that death given the pen name of joe black so a not to disturb others want to take holiday and experience the world nif this weren hollywood we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death but since it is we get scene after scene of fish out of water humor just a if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn know how to act in our society nit also doesn help that the character of death is written so inconsistently nhe claim to be on vacation but he never doe anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani just try to get your travel agent to book that one nhe speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois nhe know everything about some character nothing about others nand a played by brad pitt he not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing he just there nit a if someone told pitt never mind about acting in this picture son just stand there and look pretty nit a if pitt is doing his keanu reef impression throughout the movie ni ve used the phrase angel of death in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt performance with this year best angel performance nicolas cage in city of angel nwhere pitt is cold and unfeeling cage is a warm and empathetic a the situation allows nwhere cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man pitt is aloof and arrogant ncage struck instant chemical spark with co star meg ryan where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani character is so shallow that she can see beyond pitt good look nthe movie other top name is much better actor but that doesn save meet joe black nsir anthony hopkins isn given much better material to work with unfortunately nhe play one of these good hearted multimillionaire medium mogul that only exist in hollywood one wonder what might have happened if they had made hopkins character more realistically evil nhopkins is marked for death due to bad ticker but death step in and grant him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world nof course no one can be sure of how they will act when death tap on their shoulder nbut have to wonder and in this movie you have very long time to wonder how you or would act in similar situation especially if you or were multimillionaire nhopkins pretty much go to the office and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation nfans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated m sure ni stayed awake all the way through meet joe black and m asking myself why nmovies about death

overloaded with comedy and the hero wa too boastful and pompous to be considered sympathetic hero and after viewing it to this day find it disgrace for disney animation nwhen saw the trailer wa thinking hmm nthis isn bad at all nthis just might have potential nwhen bought the soundtrack wa really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney feature ni have never really heard of phil collins nor have heard of mark mancina so wa wondering how would these two make this disney flick spin ni wa pleasantly surprised the music is top notch nphil collins song are terrific percussion heavy piece of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney song nthe score from mark mancina wa also neat it reminded me bit of the lion king but it wa more original nso the soundtrack wasn bad at all considering it wa by two people am not familiar with nthis film could be good nbut will it be nwhen finally went to see it on opening day a tend to do with most disney animated feature my question wa answered in complete turnabout of expectation for me disney tarzan is surprisingly decent nthe story start out with tarzan parent surviving shipwreck and finding home on an island where ape live in peace nhowever one day vicious leopard sabor attack and kill tarzan parent leaving him at this time baby alone until kala of the ape rescue him nkala want to raise the child a her own she lost hers previously to sabor but her mate kerchak is not too sure it not our kind he say nhe agrees though to let her take care of little tarzan but that doesn make him my son ntarzan grows up vowing to be the best ape ever but no matter how hard he try or what he doe at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend terk he just can convince kerchak that he is one of the ape even when he defeat sabor in battle none day new animal show up human nthis is where jane come into the picture nshe is on an expedition with her father professor porter and despicable hunter clayton searching for gorilla ntarzan rescue her when she is chased by baboon and soon they get to know each other neven though tarzan fall in love with jane this cause thing to go wrong nclayton trick tarzan into taking him jane and porter to see the ape who are convinced that he ha betrayed them nworse clayton ha plotted to send the gorilla to london for money nwill tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the ape ni not gonna tell you sorry nyou re gonna have to see for yourself nand see it you should the animation is a always top notch particularly when tarzan go soaring through the tree read that skateboarding nthe deep canvas computer generated effect add an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan life in nin fact it seems similar to the computer imagery cel animation combination in rival disney animted film such a fox anastasia and dreamworks prince of egypt ncould it be that disney wa actually taking idea from their rival nthe casting is fairly good ntony goldwyn is emotionally believeable a tarzan and to my relief the animator have succeeded in not making him another hercules nnicely done and glenn close is wonderful a kala she ha beautiful singing voice too by the way nlance henrikson a kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson beast voice which make him all the more ferocious and gripping nminnie driver had me little worried at first a the voice of jane ni thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film when first saw the trailer but when saw the film didn have problem with her ni take back my insult on driver nit nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for disney animated feature he wa fflewdurr flamm in disney most underrated classic the black cauldron he is funny and delightful a professor porter non the villiany side of the voice brian blessed the guy who did bos na in star war episode the phantom menace brings pompous and later on vicious voice to the sinister clayton nhe might not be the strongest character in the film he just plain bad guy nothing else but blessed vocal work contributes greatly nbut if there is any voice that think steal the whole show it should be rosie donnell who is hilariously funny a terk nshe also ha fiesty attitude m gonna kill ya nshe say more than once ni almost sung along with her during one of the film best moment where the ape make mess of the human camp via song er scatting shoo be doo da be dah ni can see why she wanted to have rock song for the film she a good singer nnot that she wa the only funny character in the film though nwayne knight who played stan in space jam give whimsically funny style to tantor an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into un sanitary water thankfully there is no real sound of flatuence that would have killed the picture nthe song a said before are decent mostly sung by collins nthis set new standard for disney animated film because for the first time the character do not sing ni tolerate musical number from character lot more than some other guy would but found this to be nice change of pace nthe story doe have element of comedy in it but they also load it with strong dramatic touch which make this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules nif there is anything disappointing about tarzan it might be the omission of the sync version of trashing the camp from the film ni heard it on the soundtrack and wondered where it wa going to be ni wa upset that it wasn because had thought of taking few friend of mine who like sync to see tarzan noh well noverall wa enthralled with tarzan ni wouldn hold it high the way do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame my all time favorite disney classic but this film deserves high place among disney greatest achievement ni give nod to disney for following up their spectacular masterpiece mulan with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough tarzan',\n",
       " 'cinematically speaking gordon park original 1971 _shaft_ is not great film na bit slow at time and more than little rough around the edge a it build to it climactic explosion of violent action this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman black private dick that a sex machine to all the chick to the big screen hardly qualifies a groundbreaking filmmaking nyet nearly 30 year after it original release and long after the genre it spawned blaxploitation died with that decade the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness nthe reason for this is the same one that explains the film connection with moviegoer far beyond the target african american audience the title character of john shaft nwhile the fact that the strong smart virile and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance his broad based appeal stem from an idea that transcends race he is comfortable confident and proud about who he is and anyone who had problem with that could simply kiss his as nthis fact also explains why john singleton y2g revival of john shaft is a enjoyable a it is nmuch like the film that started the franchise this _shaft_ plot doesn score point in the originality department but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thriller ncontrary to what ha been reported over the past few month this _shaft_ is not remake of the original film but more of sequel spinoff nthe star audience know and love from the original film and it first two sequel 1972 _shaft s_big_score and 1973 _shaft_in_africa_ richard roundtree once again play john shaft who still run private investigation firm in new york city nhowever the focus of the film lie on his same named nephew samuel jackson who a the film begin is cop whose take no crap demeanor constantly leaf him at odds with his superior nwhen privileged young man named walter wade jr christian bale accused of brutal racially motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail disgusted shaft leaf the force and decides to take matter into his own hand a p nbut that easier said than done for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is people hernandez jeffrey wright dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri toni collette the only eyewitness to his crime npeoples or rather wright is also the big obstacle in jackson way toward commanding this film npeoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time and wright is insanely funny during these stage nhowever he isn so funny a to make the character come off a goofy and buffoonish and people eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo who bowed out before filming nit no easy task to steal film from the jackson who is his usual captivating charismatic self here but that exactly what wright doe and make it seem effortless nthen again with such talented ensemble surrounding him it is not too surprising that jackson impressive star turn doesn quite tower over the rest he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co star nbale ha already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ so it only follows that his performance a similar le exaggerated character would be spot on ncollette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight a the frightened conflicted diane nbusta rhyme brings some good laugh a shaft sidekick rasaan nregistering not a strongly but through no fault of their own are vanessa williams a tough narcotic cop carmen vasquez and dismayingly underused roundtree they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price singleton and shane salerno jackson also ha little to do in sense some throwaway footage during the opening credit aside his shaft doesn even have one sex scene nthat singleton once again prof his ability with actor is an especially good thing since he not really an action director nthis is not to say that he doe bad job with the numerous gunfight and the requisite foot and car chase nthey move well a doe the film a whole and are reasonably exciting it just that there nothing terribly inventive about them nthese set piece are functional in the way the script is they work well enough but they re unsurprising and conventional nbut if there anything that _shaft_ movie doe well it make the familiar look cool and this _shaft_ keep that tradition alive nfrom the slick title sequence scored of course to isaac hayes ever infectious oscar winning theme song which singleton wisely sprinkle throughout the film on the film look great and easily sweep the viewer into it world with it energetic bravado neven common visual trick such a employing fancy wipe for scene transition not only feel unforced it feel necessary nstyle doesn exactly make for great film but when it come to _shaft_ that of little consequence nwhat matter above all else is having good time and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun ride to be had with this bad mutha shut your mouth',\n",

the relationship between jerry and alice and even once that is over with the rest of the film seems to be lot of boredom that every once in while stop to take break for excitement nat over two hour this film could have been significantly condensed and had it running time shortened by twenty minute to half an hour but even then the action scene would not be able to save the film ninstead of truly exciting and engaging set piece we re treated to few of the generic scene with the requisite black element black helicopter men in black action suit and body armor black vehicle you know the drill nthey come on down with all kind of neat gadget and weapon but for some reason guy with just bunch of theory and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time nbig deal we ve seen it all before nwatching the film wished donner had at least tried to use little imagination but wa out of luck nnow when say it took forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice completely mean what one person is relative to the other and not romantic involvement noh donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie the two main character will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring nyou see there were more spark between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movie also directed by donner than between gibson and robert in conspiracy theory nthe two just don click and when you throw in number of happening that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether like finding out he been stalking her the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced nthe script in general also seems forced like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it then took it and forced it upon u ndialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable to the point that almost stopped listening neven gibson usual gift for ad lib couldn punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest although one of jerry theory about oliver stone wa mildly amusing nunfortunately much of what discussed in the film is not inherently important to what going on but instead filler that start out with potential but end up just being extraneous because it never followed through nfor example jerry professes that man found drowned in his swimming pool wa actually murdered by the government in new york subway station nhe even go so far a to explain that the station wa flooded at the time due to water main break hence the water in subway station and that the coroner should check the man lung for chlorine nthis is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him nyou know what happens then nnothing zip nada nno follow up whatsoever so what the significance nokay here another one na couple of well known real life assassin were found to have possessed copy of the d salinger novel the catcher in the rye njerry also ha bunch of copy nwhenever he go into bookstore he ha to buy one nleaving out the question of whether or not this make jerry an assassin we re never given reason to believe why this would make him an assassin nnot when we find out about his salinger collection not when he go to the bookstore not later on when we get the answer to our first question nthe point becomes totally extraneous noh did mention that patrick stewart is in this film nyeah he play this government psychiatrist named dr jonas who may or may not be bad guy nthat about it nfor all the presence this usually marvelous actor ha he nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory nyou can just lump him in with the supporting player with the exception of cylk cozart who play agent lowry of the fbi nthis guy wa really likable and wish he and his character had gotten more screen time nokay here my theory nthis really started out a great film but some of it joke were actually true nthe government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security and this wa what wa left over',\n",

       " 'since most movie about slavery shield u from the true horror of what they re portraying it fitting to say that beloved come a real shock a film nit confusing bizarre and a tough film to watch a any film ve seen all year and that not necessarily because of the three hour running time beloved is challenging to watch filled with tough and powerful poetry that take u completely off guard and instead of straight forward hollywood ized story about what happened to the slave after they were freed beloved come off a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened or rather toni morrison who wrote the novel upon which this is based beloved tell the story of an ex slave named sethe played by oprah winfrey who life on large farm in the north with her child nwhen the film open her house is being terrorized by poltergeist which shake thing up wound the dog and make thing generally uncomfortable for the family nsethe is proud though and will not move nher son run away leaving only her and her daughter denver kimberly elise alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation na couple year pas and the ghost remains and one day man named paul danny glover another ex slave who knew sethe year ago when they worked on plantation together arrives asking for lodging nhe ha been wandering around since he left the plantation and when he enters the house it turn red and becomes incredibly hot nwhen he remark about what he think is evil sethe reply it ain evil nit just sad nsome more time pass and paul ha become fervent member of the household and the ghost disappears nbut when they return one day from going out they discover young woman sitting in the house nher name is beloved and a played by thandie newton she ha almost zero motor skill nshe stumble around half grabbing onto thing and knocking them over and when she speaks she let out low guttural sound that eventually turn into baby talk nthey let her into her house and she begin to turn thing upside down beloved act like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with ghost story nmost of the scene consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic low lit room with the occasional flash to the past where we see image of such horror that we thank god for modern day psychoanalyst nsethe and paul have lived through such hellish time that they are forever implanted with the memory of their slavehood on the old plantation which includes such image a sethe being raped by the white plantation hand with her nipple being licked prompting her to cry out to paul when reminiscing about it they took my milk nworst of all wa the month after her freedom when she wa allowed to live like free person working with other black on farm and then seeing that her old plantation owner have arrived to presumedly take her and her child back nshe run to the barn near by carrying her four child and when her old owner burst in they discover she ha murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don leave them alone nwhen she is inquired about this moment by paul in moment halfway through the film she say she doesn regret it nshe killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did and she ha convinced herself she did the right thing nof course beloved is really her daugher materialized though we aren flat out told that until later on in the film nbeloved represents the pain and suffering the slave went through and show how difficult it wa for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long nthus beloved becomes sorta redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci fi classic solaris where cosmonaut discovers that his wife who commited suicide year before ha materialized when he is orbiting over planet with complex brain system nthat film spoke volume about humanity and our memory how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past and when if it ever literally came back to haunt u it would control u completely beloved move along freely without lot of explanation and for the most part this is extremely respectable nthe most interesting film are the one that don explain everything for u leaving gap in the character that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense nsethe is never fully explained a character but we understand all her action since she being played by oprah winfrey nit been well over decade since her last major performance in the color purple but judging from these two film ll bet she one of the best actress working today if nshe wa strictly an actress nher talk show which suppose is great entity ha prevented her from becoming noteworthy actress and that a shame because she brings so much to this movie nemotion nsadness nstrength nwatching the strong sethe who so afraid of the past that she built rather strong protective coating around herself break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what make this movie really great nshe make it real nthat not to say this is perfect film nin fact d wager to say that the fact that it confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is nwhile oprah performance is powerful and easily sympathetic and m dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february the structure of the film which doesn show what happened to her child till halfway through the film prevents u from really making cohesive connection to the film nit doesn necessarily move a though they re memory of one particular character and by the end it ha lost control over sethe and a she take to bed we are unable to truly identify with her anymore nbut despite it tediousness perhaps that the point nthe distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it ha been built from the start since they figure she ha crossed over from being identifiable and it need to get back with reality nand for the most part this film seems like the cry of pain from the slave that it really want to be njonathan demme direction is bizarre in nature with the story and he creates the right mood making it tough film to sit through making sure that the audience feel a uncomfortable a the character nthere more to admire here like the way that the flashback pop up freely and without real organization just like they would be in real life and the way that the ending leaf it somewhat open to more pain and suffering but laced with touch of optimism nthe acting not only from winfrey is amazing and anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination neveryone ha been raving about thandie newton performance and how it should be rewarded nhowever it must be noted that out of everyone she had the easiest part nact like baby nthrow thing nstumble around nchew food with your mouth open ni do think there another performance worthy of oscar conisderation but it kimberly elise a the daugher who ha to stay sensible and sane and ha to carry the burden of her mother loss of reality towards the end nit not that newton isn great she a annoying and wacky a the role demand nit just that elise ha the tougher job and pull it off even better ndespite the fact that this film ha winfrey written all over it and not that of writer morrison or director demme beloved ha still not done well ncosting think around ninety million dollar it ha since grossed about twenty two nunfortunately this film is little too intense for viewer even for me and can stand almost anything recently viewed the 2 1 2 hour long epic caligula the worst film have ever seen in my life and did it in mere 2 sitting nalthough respect beloved can say that really enjoyed it',\n",

which crime scheme go wrong and spin increasingly out of control fargo miller crossing blood simple and off the wall comedy centered around an eccentric scatter brained lead character raising arizona the hudsucker proxy ntheir latest offering the big lebowski fall within the latter category though there are element of the crime gone wrong theme and even touch of satire to be found in this film nthe main difference however is that while the protagonist of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspiration and ideal but didn quite have the brain to get it all together the main character of the big lebowski seems like fairly intelligent guy who wise to the world but he doesn really want to do much of anything besides go bowling smoke pot and generally relax nthat main character is jeffrey the dude lebowski jeff bridge introduced by the film rambling narrator sam elliott a quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county nthe dude is unemployed needle to say and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friend walter john goodman borderline psychotic who in the habit of pulling gun when he think somebody cheating in bowling match ha the whole world gone crazy he shout at suspected cheater and donny steve buscemi who always few step behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it donny you have no frame of reference here nthese three seem to more or le live for bowling tournament and a the film begin they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana john turturro who when we first meet him is doing dance in the bowling lane to accompany spanish version of hotel california and if it possible seems to be even more of head case than walter nif that doesn give you good idea of this film absurdist tone then perhaps this will the entire scenario which drive the story is set in motion by two thug mistakenly urinating on the dude rug nthey ve mistaken him for millionaire of the same name who is also known a the big lebowski david huddleston and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny tara reid owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ben gazzara nthe dude go to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug he doesn have any luck but when bunny is apparently kidnapped the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the 1 million ransom nunfortunately walter get involved and foul up the drop off and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnapper the dude car get stolen along with the briefcase containing the money nsoon the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by group of german nihilist who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debt to treehorn nmeanwhile the big lebowski daughter maude julianne moore feminist avant garde artist who like to make grand entrance swinging through the air naked want to recover the money for her family nthe plot however is really just vehicle for all these bizarre character to run wild and wreak their own unique form of havoc nthe preview for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival run through the jungle and it fit the coens see los angeles a veritable jungle of oddball and nutcase with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble usually unsuccessfully nthe film doesn feature quite a many one liner and sight gag a the coens other comedy though there are few hilarious moment of visual humor particularly in the dude dream sequence and acid flashback but it more than make up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange character interact nthe film sometimes seems little disjointed a result you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their character loose in this jungle but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imagination but for the most part the characterization are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turn out to be somewhat anticlimactic resolution nthere also noticeable but not too heavy handed thread of social commentary in the big lebowski which incidentally take place just a the gulf war is about to begin at the beginning we see george bush on television making his this aggression will not stand speech nthe coens take aim at just about every elite a subculture in the book the egotistical wealthy businessman the bum will always lose nshouts the big lebowski at one point the porn industry the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their peaceful beach community and so on nby the end we really start to admire the dude who almost certainly harbor the least aggression of anyone in this story his passive resistance emphasis on passive albeit to the elite emerges a something more than just another quirky characterization in film overflowing with quirky character nhe also turn out to have pretty well functioning brain in his head even if he doesn like to use it very much his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman show that he know when he getting run around and he doe manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end nthe coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness but they don just treat him a fodder for cheap shot either ni think that more than anything is what make the big lebowski standout comedy it manages to approach character like the dude and to some extent walter with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter brained naudience member may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un dynamic duo by the end of the movie given that they seemed like nothing more than the butt of an extended joke at first it good knowin he out there the dude takin it easy posit the narrator towards the end ni

use this tired storyline but it seems like 10 000 000 000 nthe ex however though following many of the standard cliche of this thriller subgenre differs slightly from the norm in that at least it doesn take itself too seriously like so many other dud do malicious and stalked are two example which come to mind nthose involved in the movie realize they re in turkey apparently and turn in hammy performance which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script nthe ex storyline a said incorporates many cliche predominant in film of it nature however the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that after while the viewer must accept that logic doe not operate in the realm of the movie ndiedre david first wife kill and kill and kill for example without ever having to worry about police investigation and the like it not a though she bright enough not to leave fingerprint at the scene of the crime ndavid and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time

the movie the connection between him and his son is not made nmolly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she a child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son ntime

probably like it much better ni don mean to necessarily suggest however that the ex is memorable exercise in camp neven when viewed from an it so bad it good angle this movie isn all that successful

about when diedre take out her therapist in another ridiculous scene diedre therapist wish to have her recommitted so she decides to visit diedre alone in her new apartment never realizing of course that it not her ntherapists typically are catatonically brain dead in these movie nhaving successfully snuffed the woman out diedre look at the body and say what wa it that you always said to me at the end of each session dr jones noh that right i sorry but your time is up nthis is what pass for humor in the film nthe audience doesn necessarily laugh but groan the type of groan that suggests the audience can believe they re watching this crap although watching it they are nnick mancuso chainsmoking nervous wreck character doe not have the cheesy line that butler character delivers but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief nin between drag off his cigarette for instance in one of the movie best scene david try to explain to his lawyer what creep his

tell story but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something nbut most director seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of story nso whenever director us the camera to it fullest potential the film almost automatically deserves good review nand when they add fascinating story to it you have nearly perfect entertainment nfincher the game is no exception to this nthe game is one of the most interesting and complex film to come out of hollywood in long time nfincher hasn made film since seven his box office and critical hit which defied expectation and became one of the best movie ever nso it is about time he made another film nand what ride it is nthe game isn quite a powerful a seven but in some way it is better noverall the game could have used little more clarity or little more uncertainty nit walk line of insanity and reality but it never go either way until the very end nthe outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding event and it make lot of sense once everything is set straight nunfortunately unlike the usual suspect we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening whether it be true or false nhowever this also give the film frightening aspect which the game us to the fullest extent nthe game is told completely from it main character point of view nnicholas van orton michael douglas is high strung and isolated businessman nhe life alone in his giant mansion divorced from his wife elizabeth and is celebrating his 48th birthday the same age at which his father committed suicide at in the same mansion nfor his 48th birthday conrad sean penn the rebel of the family give nicholas gift certificate to cr consumer recreation service it will make your life fun again his brother promise

emotional and psychological need explains feingold none day nicholas get call from cr and they explain that he failed the test neven more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up he start asking around to see what people can tell him about the company nwhat he doesn realize is that the game ha already begun nthe phone call is just the first of many strange event to be thrown nicholas way nhow he find out that he is involved ha to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive nthe detail involved in fincher shot is incredible and almost requires second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them nwith seven fincher had almost every single shot mean something nhe also ha the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he want you to ncompared to seven though the game is light and comical nbecause of this film sense of humor and self awareness nothing can be taken quite seriously nso don try to make much sense of what go on in the game because it doesn want you to nwhat doe make sense is the final revelation when everything becomes apparent and clear nif taken a it is the game ending make complete sense nbut if you try and critique every minute detail then you get yourself into plot hole and incredibility nperhaps that is the reason docked the film nwhile trying to remain realistic and plausible the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen nwe don really care if douglas character life or not because it isn believable nthe ending requires you to have believed anything that ha happened previously but if you suspend disbelief and take the film a it is you can accept the game a an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller nmichael douglas give terrific performance a nicholas ndouglas ha played lonely businessmen before but here he add another level to his performance nhis character who is normally level headed and relies on fact is forced to trust nobody ncan he believe the waitress he bumped into nwhat about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ndouglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well and give one of his best performance even better than his falling down persona nthe supporting cast is essential in this film and casting wa critical nsean penn is always good and he give yet another credible performance a douglas brother ndeborah kara unger from crash is the waitress he bump into and her performance is extremely good nin fact she almost steal the film from douglas njames rebhorn portrays his character very well and add some confusion and desparation to douglas predicament nanother good performance come from armin mueller stahl from shine a the book editor nbut considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game he not only command this cast but make this distant and lonely character come to colorful life nthe game is rated for language violence some gore and some nudity and drug nwhat is essential for this film to work is the writing njohn brancato and michael ferris have woven confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue and some very funny moment nthis screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it doe almost exactly the same thing the usual suspect did nhowever the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot nand if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year best film',\n",

       " 'the following review encompasses two version of dune ndune the theatrical version 1984 runtime 137 minute capsule review cut down to just over two hour by nervous studio executive the theatrical version of dune is spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book nthe film visual splendour mystical beauty and impressive action scene only partly compensate for gaping hole in the narrative ndune the extended version 1988 runtime 189 minute capsule review bit of throw together assembled by mca tv special project for cable television nit wa disowned by director david lynch but it considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of it improved characterisation and clearer storyline nquality dub of this version from the out of print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealer on the world wide web the review nreleased in 1984 and made on then mammoth budget of 40 million the film of frank herbert cult novel dune wa eagerly awaited by sci fi fan ndirector david lynch blue velvet eraserhead twin peak wa working on his biggest production to date mammoth undertaking filmed under trying condition on location in mexico nthe screenplay wa lynch own chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert wa rejected ndune is set in universe ruled by powerful family overseen by successive line of emperor nthe key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis dune windswept desert planet that home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange nthe spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe nit extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it nmost importantly it allows the navigator of the spacing guild once human but now hideously mutated to fold space and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distance instantaneously enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish nlynch film by necessity excise part of the book while retaining the story two main strand none is the long standing rivalry between two family house atreides and house harkonnen and their battle for lucrative mining right on arrakis nthe second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides a the reluctant messiah long awaited by the native of arrakis the fremen nthe deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that man would come from the outer world and lead them to freedom nunfortunately this epic story unfolds in confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film which run 30 to 60 minute shorter than what lynch originally intended nthe thinking among universal oh so wise money men wa that film over two hour in duration were not popular with audience at the time and would not do well at the box office nwith lynch initial cut running at closer to three or more hour the studio demanded that further cut be made nwhat great idea nwhy not trim down an already complex film so a to make it almost incomprehensible nthe most glaring consequence of this one eyed stupidity is hopelessly jumpy narrative leaving u with badly underdeveloped character nthus their personality are vague their motivation unclear and in the case of paul father duke leto their demise rather meaningless nthe end result is distinct chill we can warm to most of the cast and we don care much for them nand it hardly help that the voice over narration is sparse and that the dune esque language and terminology sound like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book ndune is also very serous film nthe constant self talk by various character make it so serious and self absorbed at time that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment nthe overall impression is world full of people so intense that no one is allowed joke lest the universe come crashing down around them nhumour or at least gentle kind of humour a distinct from the harkonnen mad sadistic kind is hard to find nyou may balk at the comparison but a writer lynch could well have done with some lesson from george lucus star war trilogy nthe theatrical version is still some way from being complete disaster however nit still posse enough of lynch stylistic quirk and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewer with taste for imaginative sci fi nspecial effect whiz carlo rambaldi giant sandworms are an awesome sight nboth the production design anthony master and costume design bob ringwood are striking and original nand the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtrack of the last twenty year nwith these element in place and the benefit of freddie francis lush cinematography the film is at least feast for the sens nsee it in the widescreen format if you can nand despite all the cut several cast member still make strong impression most notably kenneth mcmillan a the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen nsian phillips also register strongly a the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam leader of the bene gesserit religious order who secret aim is to manipulate paul destiny for it own shadowy end na paul atreides the young kyle maclachlan start off somewhat shakily but a his character grows in strength so doe his performance and he emerges a credible leader of the fremen crusade nthe conclusion nany assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert original novel is complex piece of work and present tough challenge for any filmmaker ndavid lynch took brave stab at it and partly due to force beyond his control ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respect ndune certainly confused and frustrated lot of people on it release nmany chose to stay away altogether a the film disastrous box office showing attests nthe extended version however is rather different beast nin 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition director cut of the film on home video clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatre nbut ala he failed to do so choosing to move on to other project nin way then it is partly lynch own fault that what appeared instead wa an unauthorised extended version put together in 1988 by mca tv special project for airing on cable network in the usa nstung into action lynch successfully petitioned the director guild to take his name off the credit and replace it with allen smithee the standard pseudonym for director who wish to disown their own work nhe also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous juda booth ncertainly looking at the result of mca handiwork there at least half dozen instance that for sheer technical sloppiness are good enough reason for the director to object nbut these gripe must be considered in light of the improvement that the extended cut of dune offer in several crucial area nmost of the change involve the restoration or extension of cut scene and the addition of extra narration both of which fill many hole in the original version storyline npaul relationship with his father and associate is more intimate with moment of humour and warmth lacking previously nthe political skulduggery involving the emperor the spacing guild the bene gesserits and the two warring house is far better explained npaul initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably nand a further background new prologue ha been added featuring narration and painted still to give u brief history of the dune universe na piece of storytelling then mca tv version of dune is clearly superior na piece of editing however it is at time surprisingly inept nthe use of painted still in the new prologue work well enough but their occasional appearance once the action begin is inappropriate nthere some sloppy cutting too and in few instance shot even appear out of order nand the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scene eg nships coming and going soldier coming and going is at time clearly out of context nthis is the kind of thing to which lynch objected and rightly so nit should also be noted that several questionable scene and shot from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demand of s television nbut the most notable omission is gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn even in herbert book nthe scene feature baron harkonnen killing beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchman by pulling out his heart plug nit surreal and disturbing episode that very lynch esque but add nothing to what we already know the baron is nasty piece of work ndespite it own peculiar flaw then the extended version of dune is generally superior film nall up it contains 35 minute of restored footage and approximately another 15 minute of either altered fabricated or newly created sequence nunless the idiosyncratic lynch ha sudden change of heart the alan smithee version remains the closest we ll get to what the movie should have been non repeated viewing one suspect it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit nstill a one of this century great science fiction novel some fan and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved better fate in it transfer to the screen nwith rumour circulating of new six hour mini series planned by production company new

his king and queen were killed nthe king sorcerer amblyn who also lost his job decided to take abraham under his wing a an apprentice nduring the downtime in his unemployment amblyn decided to create new dimension where sorcery evil and torture ruled nabraham wished to follow his master into this new realm so he wa asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love nin this new realm amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the human that would be brought to this realm nafter each murder abraham would become stronger until his power surpassed that of amblyn nbecause of the screw up that allowed the recent escape abraham wa able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself na alison quest to find abraham and show him the error of his way the six new hapless human are allowed to live out their worst nightmare and then be brutally murdered nif there one thing can stand when see film it when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty nfilms like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst example of this and now ice from the sun can be added to this list nthis

designed like music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random image from the film interspersed with other random image nthe credit run the entire length of the song which is almost five minute and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesn pop up until near the end of the sequence nwhen the opening credit began thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and interstitial from mtv2 had found it way to my tv nat least the music in the film is pretty decent made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even feature song by ramona midgett nat the beginning of the film it is established that the presence posse supernatural power like shooting bullet out of the palm of his hand and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them and he talk like darth vader clone without the heavy breathing nfor some reason though he delegate all of his main stalking to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance none over alled cretin handle

of young woman who ha been transformed into half dog half human mix with shotgun and of course big truck driving guy that like to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone road before pouring salt all over their wound nwhy would you want to give responsibility to bunch of redneck when you yourself had all of these cool power nand how is it that the fellow that screw over all of his buddy is able to round up exactly five friend to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ni can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment nthe most ridiculous segment though come right before the aforementioned dragging salting sequence nthe character in question dana angela zimmely ha her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of movie theater in which the presence is seated na priest holding two naked dirty human on leash walk in and sits down next to large platter of fried chicken nhe pick up the entire platter and start to enjoy the chicken taunting dana a she look on with no interest whatsoever nwhen she start to leave the priest chides her for going before the performance start and then something that look like either creature from gwar show or terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life walk out and make like it want to be crucified by her nthe presence start to clap annoyingly which continues for the rest of the sequence until dana take off with the strange creature following her nwhen it finally catch up to her she stab it in it giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurt from the ruptured organ nthe box for the film claim because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture parental discretion is advised for person under the age of 18 ncontains nudity and graphic violence nwhile both is certainly true there doesn seem to be much of either in any large amount nbesides loving close up of spurting neck stump semi graphic self surgery scene and two instance of head trauma one run over and one melting most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety na for nudity it is very sparse but at least we

ominous bar of composer john williams now infamous score ndah dum nfrom there director steven spielberg waste no time taking u into the water on midnight swim with beautiful girl that turn deadly nright away he let u know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean and once jaw ha attacked it never relinquishes it grip nperhaps what is most outstanding about jaw is how spielberg build the movie nhe work it like theatrical production with first act and second act nunlike so many modern filmmaker he ha great deal of restraint and refuse to show u the shark until the middle of the second act nuntil then he merely suggests it presence with creepy subjective underwater shot and williams music nhe building the tension bit by bit so when it come time for the climax the shark arrival is truly terrifying nhe doesn let u get bored with the imagery nthe first act open with police chief martin brody roy scheider new york cop who ha taken an easy peaceful job running the police station on amity island fictitious new england resort town where there hasn been murder or gun fired in 25 year nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attack right before the fourth of july and the mayor larry vaughn murray hamilton doesn want to shut down the beach because the island is reliant on summer tourist money nbrody is joined by matt hooper richard dreyfus young ambitious shark expert from the marine institute nhooper is a fascinated by the shark a he is determined to help brody stop it his knowledge about the exact working of the shark it a perfect engine an eating machine make it that much more terrifying nwhen vaughn finally relents hooper and brody join crusty old shark killer named quint robert shaw on his decrepit boat the orca to search for the shark nthe entire second act take place on the orca a the three men hunt the shark and inevitably are hunted by it jaw is thriller with keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing tension and horror nit is like ten movie all rolled into one and it no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time until it wa unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by star war neven today fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock psycho and it never seems to age nalthough grand new technology exists that make the technical sequence including several mechanical shark obsolete none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill nthe technical limitation faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic element like pacing characterization sharp editing and creative photography instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effect nscheider dreyfus and shaw were known actor at the time jaw wa made but none of them had the draw of robert redford or paul newman nnevertheless this film guaranteed them all successful career because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark nscheider hit just the right note a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what right and going against the entire town it your first summer here you know mayor vaughn warns him ndreyfuss who had previously been seen in american graffiti 1973 and the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz 1974 give surprisingly mature complex performance for someone who had literally only played kid and teenager nhowever most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw a the movie captain ahab performance sorely overlooked by the academy award nbordering of parody shaw play quint a grizzled old loner whose machismo border on masochism nhe slightly deranged and shaw performance is almost caricature nhowever there is one scene late in the film when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scar nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experience aboard the s nindianapolis navy ship in world war ii that wa sunk by the japanese nhis tale of floating in the water for more than week with over 1 000 other men while swarm of shark slowly devoured them them is actually more hair raising than anything spielberg put on screen nshaw delivers the story in one long take and it is the best acting in the film nof course we can leave out the shark itself with it black eye endless row of teeth and insatiable urge to eat it is basically the epitome of all mankind fear about what is unknown and threatening in nature na shark is such perfect nemesis it is real having survived sinch the dinosaur great white do exist they can be a large a the shark in jaw and they are threat nevery one of spielberg subjective underwater shot make u feel queasy because let u see how we look to the shark bunch of writihing dangling completely unprotected leg just ready to be chomped into nthe shark in jaw wa actually combination of actual footage and five different mechanical shark all nicknamed bruce by the crew built to be shot from different angle nmany have forgotten but jaw wa sort of precursor to waterworld 1995 movie who soggy production and cost overrun had universal studio worried about bomb nbut a we can see now spielberg overcame all the obstacle and delivered one of the finest primal scare thriller ever to come out of hollywood',\n",

particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr cameron early work nin fact virus is yet another in the long line of action horror paranoia thriller from the alien vein group of people are dropped into mysterious situation only to find mortally threatening entity is out to get them textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkie and maybe even to the first picture albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budget to come in his future nno such thing will happen to bruno whom believe worked in some capacity on that quasi landmark feature while bruno may have studied under cameron wing for year and year m beginning to wonder at what capacity and what exactly did he learn from him nin fact virus should at least be mediocre the fact that bruno could have worked under man like cameron director who if anything just know how to make movie and then make film like virus is just another detraction fairly aimed at this grade schlockfest of film albeit z grade schlockfest with respectable budget nthe film seems to not only borrow it plot from last year similarly fated deep rising but also from clunkish movie from the 80 called leviathan an underwater thriller starring peter weller richard crenna hector elizando and daniel stern about group of miner who stumble upon an alien lifeform that wa part alien part john carpenter twisted remake of the thing virus again ha similar uh selling point group of sailor on boat stumble upon russian cruiser that is dead in the water nthey get on nthey break up into pair and investigate nand they find an alien lifeform on board that come in the form of energy ha taken over all the machine on board have meshed the machine with part from corps and have deemed humankind their enemy because of misquote in the dictionary ha ha nnot that any of this is for second scary or the least bit involving not only doe this film start off with chintzy bond ian opening the destruction of the cruiser via satellite transmission from mir destroying any of the suspense in what could happen but it also fails to bring u any interesting chracters nof it motley crew it only choses a it potentially eccentric cast of character lead woman skipper masculine potential romantic interest drunken captain black technician tatooed aborigine manic russian survivor and couple other candidate for alien food none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than thin plain piece of writing paper nand it not the traditional argument for film like these where you may in fact want them all to be eaten even alien played with the karma of the arrogant soldier but this wa more of plus side for the film a whole than the opposite instead a another cliche go you just don give damn ni almost don even have to say that the acting from everyone range from sub par to horrific the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what strong female lead she is and she is just not really here and the latter being and it pain me to say this a he a particular favorite of mine donald sutherland who play the captain so poorly and without second of credibility that this will go down a the performance of which he should be ashamed nlike anthony hopkins for legend of the fall the line scrooooooo em ha been thus embroidered upon my membrance nor peter toole in caligula ngreat actor horrific performance nit happens every now and then and it only help sutherland career that no one except for an elite few even bothered to see this film nthough it ha sat on the shelf of universal studio for about two year waiting until it can be released and make a much money a it possibly can read early january when everyone still trying to catch up on the potential oscar nominee it doe show that universal shelled out pretty penny to make this film it laden with complex machinery boast respectable production design and it may even feature believable special effect if of course or anyone else could see them virus mostly take place on large abandoned cruiser and mostly at night until the dawn and mostly without the use of light not so much for the productivity of the alien creature in their pursuit of their human prey but more so because a the hollywood cliche seems to go if it dark enough then the special effect will be more believable nand if you don believe me go back and rent godzilla and tell me if there even one shot where we see godzilla either in his entirety in one wide shot or n the light so that we can at least see him well you don really have to sit through it again just take my word for it nbut all of this doesn matter since virus is basically just one loud cluttered mess of movie nthe action scene are muddled and a difficult to follow a any action movie ve ever seen my um favorite part wa the scene where trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship during five minute bouillabaisse of tidal wave rain and any other ocean extremeties the film can cook up then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned well must say thanks for telling me afterwards because sure couldn figure it out when saw it nimagine the first attack of the alien in alien shot from the pov of the soldier and then the authority in the battle car if it wa all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity and that basically the whole of virus one horribly directed action scene after the other capping it off with proposterous gadget that save the day and at least couple of the original cast member nand my god it a long damn sit nwith no interesting character no dramatic urgency no tension not one good moment of action and no mesmerizing visuals it a wonder that it even got made nwe already know that big movie studio mentality is shallow at best and movie like out of sight and saving private ryan give you more faith in them but movie like virus manage to drain little more out of the pool ni almost wish that instead of making this movie john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meeting with universal head when they gave this film green light nthey read the script they knew they were entrusting million upon million of dollar into director who might have very well been cameron hack and he is and they still went ahead with the project only to have bruno and company shit back in their face

       " 'it been good long while since we had good old fashioned thriller where mostly everything go right for the audience and wrong for the character but it been even longer since saw thriller that actually shock cared for the character not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foible flaw and strength to emerge so radiantly ni saw that it been at least couple decade even a far back to the great hitchcock thriller though m hardly comparing simple plan to say rear window or stranger on train nyet it almost a good nit simple yet strangely complex and astonishingly rewarding because instead of moving from plot point to plot point and merely laying out they might be caught overtone it instead concern itself with the moral corruption and depth of greed that it protagonist can go to all without ever judging them a either evil or even immoral nelegantly directed by sam raimi yes the same simple plan concern itself with the discovery of crashed plane and within bag full of million of dollar by an upright moderately financially stable working man bill paxton his dim witted brother billy bob thornton and his drinking buddy brent briscoe nwithout anyone around and the possibility that no one would come looking for it the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes they will keep it but until any authority or possible owner of the cash come looking and so they generally don flaunt anything they don want to flaunt they ll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton nthe possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authority they could try to fight off the rightful owner who are either villainous or just or they could fight amongst themselves a simple plan though borrows little from each of these na little tiff with the cop here subplot involving an alleged fbi agent chilling gary cole there and bit of inside feuding over here nbut a austin power would say that not necessarily it bag baby nwhat most admired about this film and what make this far superior and unique thriller is that it successfully able to have it cake and eat it too nit effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliche like the one mentioned above but at the same time it involves itself more deeply with the way the character become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in black duffle bag nso while step are taken to neatly cover thing up and these subsequent step go miserably awry the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering thing up to the extent that these character have to they are slowly losing their soul and their humanity nin one early scene paxton and thornton have to make trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn look like it wa all stolen not bad idea when thornton screw up a he doe continuously throughout the movie and paxton ha to do some major covering up read homicide ninstead of quick murder and immeadiate hand washing raimi show lengthy painful shot from low angle onto paxton face a he try to sift through his emotion and reach conclusion nthere a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective but the previous shot is even better more morally complex and more gut wrenching nin short probably the best piece of direction raimi ever done demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yield the best result for further proof watch persona sex scene and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman ever done nbut the film hardly stop here it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of it character humanity and the depletion thereof nyet it also move from step to step in such graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot point of the story nwhen the time come for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical with aid from his pregnant wife played by bridget fonda pal to raimi he doe and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic height nthere at least two grand shootout and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootout in cinema history and when they arrive they don come with masochistic delight but with cringe inducing horror nduring the one wa actually sinking into my chair with the mantra they can do this can they nstreeming through my head nin fact this film which is getting many comparison to the coen superior but forget about it fargo ha many similar moment of manic insanity attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the director direct what in other hand would be over the top distractedness imagine suppose robert rodriguez directing this then nagain after seeing the evil dead film d hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off although there are moment of the film which are easily dubbed raimi moment rifle shot notwithstanding ninstead raimi directs with maturity and gentle touch easily letting the story and character co exist while still letting some of the more traditional raimi element come out like some offbeat comic touch nmost particularly billy bob thornton character jacob is brilliant creation nhis dim wittedness is often hilarious for most of the film every line he uttered wa greeted with howling laughter but there authenticity to the performance that strangely enough make sure that we re not totally laughing at him nthe chuckle he get are not necessarily one of full condescension because thornton is so damn real njacob a multi dimensional character and while being stupid we see that a not so much flaw but strength to his character his simplicity is endearing and many of the act he commits are out of strong inner strength and belief system primarily towards the middle where his bud and co conspirator begin to make some heavy wave concerning the money nthe final third of the film spends much time with him and many of the touch upon his character not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott smith adapting his own book by the way are just great ni particularly admired back story about an old high school girlfriend told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near sweetness and further strength of his saddened character nthornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance by far the best performance he ever given and further proof that he the best character actor in contemporary cinema if you don believe me go back and watch his wonderful performance in primary color performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn been in the same year because he easily able to slip into character and make him completely and utterly believable nhe brings so much weight to the film that a it is with most character actor it difficult picturing anyone else in the role nthe rest of the cast is great too from paxton declining working man to chelcie ross amiable town sheriff neven fonda show off her talent nicely nand if had any complaint about the film it that the plot is almost too simplistic and that at time it seems too much like an exercise like cruel test on humanity that still pay attention to the humanity involved nand the occasional narration is a it usually is annoying narration should be used with extreme caution especially when you re trying to set thing up and or express emotion didn raimi watch the first murder scene nand the thing that can most usually go wrong with movie the ending is basically amiss ni won reveal it but it way too cruel and too much of an outsider set up a if the appearance of plane wasn already too much of that anyway nfor film that deal so much and so intimately with the humanity of the character involved this is the wrong ending nimagine character controlled ending otherwise it like if in crime and punishment if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing not that m at all comparing simple plan to dostoevsky nthe ending doe work despite my protestation but to me there wa something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it but if you had no qualm and were happy a clam with it then just ignore me and go about your day nbut despite my mere claim make no mistake that wa completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout and even sometimes curdling up by the situation that occured not because of any kind of gore factor which is thankfully for this very minimal but because the film place it character in situation and give them such painful thing to overcome that ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile nat least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece',\n",
       " 'most people fit into two different category you either love woody allen or you hate his gut nmy family for the most part hate him and his movie ni think he very funny but his shtick ha gotten forced and contrived over the year nso maybe taking his body away wa the best decision any producer could have thought of nunrestrained by physical boundary allen humor come shining through nthose who had problem with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of u in laughing at allen intelligent observation of life nthose who had problem with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one nin 1995 film wa introduced to audience which sparked their imagination and showed them something they never seen before ntoy story used state of the art computer technology and presented world of toy who would come alive when no human were present nmany critic will call that better film but believe they only say that because it wa completely original motion picture nantz however ha upped the ante considerably ndisney a bug life isn due out for another two month and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal nby beating disney out they have satisfied the audience thirst for computer animated film nbut don let that fool you disney is definitely not scared nin the past two year competition have broken out between studio nin 1997 it wa the volcano duel nin my opinion dante peak came out way ahead of it predecessor both in time and in quality nvolcano had an original premise but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situation nin 1998 there are twice a many competing film nfirst wa the comet competition and armageddon blew away it cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact nbut now it even more interesting a one beloved studio disney go up against the newcomer dreamworks nwho will prevail ntime will tell but m sure that mr mouse ha nothing to fear nthis may sound like didn like antz on the contrary d put it up there with toy story nbut due to it pg rating many parent may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn appear in disney version nsome of the dialogue in antz push the envelope for family oriented film nsexual innuendo and profanity pop up occasionally which make dreamworks animated feature geared more for an adult crowd nthe humor is also written especially for adult though many kid were laughing in the theater attended nthis is the type of film that should be made for family more often entertaining for kid and entertaining for parent nantz begin with hilarious monologue which seems meld between woody allen shtick and franz kafka metamorphosis the short story of man who wake up to discover himself a bug nz allen is troubled ant believing he wa not made to be worker when you re the middle child in family of five million he comment about his neglected childhood none night is sitting in bar with his friend weaver sylvester stallone discussing his pathetic place in life nin walk princess bala sharon stone whom no one recognizes without crown nbala asks is he would like to dance and they engage in pulp fiction esque dance while everyone else is following the leader nafter discovering that she is the princess fall in love but there a problem bala is getting married to general mandible gene hackman ruthless leader who merely want to control better and stronger colony nin order to do that he must eliminate not only the queen anne bancroft but the weakest of the colony namely the worker ant nbut to get rid of the queen he need to get rid of the loyal army ant who would be willing to die for her nhe and colonel cutter christopher walkin come up with plan to send the loyal ant off to battle where they will surely be killed nthe queen is reluctant at first but decides it is best for the colony nmeanwhile want to meet bala again and he asks weaver an army ant to switch place with him nso get sent off to battle but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termite nthe battle sequence is absolutely stunning though you may have flashback to starship trooper which contained very similar sequence nhowever antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time so the similarity are merely coincidence nthe second half of the film revolves around s kidnapping of bala and their search for mythical place called insectopia nthere an ant can be his own bos and have all the food he want nthe adventure and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension especially one involving magnifying glass nlooming over the target like the spaceship from independence day in fact m just going to assume that the producer referenced id4 intentionally nthe ant look up in awe and then beam of fire blast into the ground nvisually it an exciting rush of adrenaline nbut don be fooled nlittle kid shouldn see this a they may just try and copy it nafter seeing antz vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again nhopefully child will learn that killing ant is rather cruel na an animated film antz is probably the best you will find to date nvisually it a stunning a what dream may come nthe best aspect of animation is the fact that the character aren limited by gravity nthey can take ridiculous situation and make them seem plausible none great moment involves mass of worker ant bunching up to form wrecking ball nthe animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball nhowever the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of young boy shoe nit truly great example of film making at it finest nwith computer technology the animator have carefully made the ant face look similar to the actor providing the voice nthe best example would have to be barbatus danny glover nat one point you can even see the pore on his face although doubt ant have pore ndo they nbarbatus also ha touching but rather gruesome scene a he ha his final word with without body nyoung kid may be disturbed by the site of dismembered head but good deal of humor is derived more appropriate for adult of course ndisney a bug life look good but don know if they will be able to best dreamworks newest animated feature in term of animation nif not then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do go head to head with the big mouse and knock him down yes anastasia wa good but not nearly a good a even the worst of disney nvocal talent is always essential to an animated feature and antz ha one of the best line ups seen since toy story nin fact it far exceeds that one nwoody allen ha always been funny but here he transcends most of what he done in the past few year nwithout body his comic timing is the most noticeable thing nin fact m pretty sure that the writer let him improvise lot of his line nsharon stone a bala show off some of her comic ability though for the most part stone work best a dramatic actress nsylvester stallone teamed up with stone once again is beginning to solidify his statement that he want to be an actor not typecast action star nafter snub at the oscar last year stallone is proving himself a the serious or comedic a illustrated here actor that he is ngene hackman is superb a the gruff talking general almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona nchristopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice and so many people will remember him from such hit a batman return nanne bancroft ha minimal role but she effective nonetheless ndanny glover ha small role but he doe very very good job ndan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voice a two lovesick euro trash bee both are very unrecognizable especially aykroyd njennifer lopez play worker ant who fall in love with weaver although most people won recognize her voice either nmany people will recognize grant shaud voice a the foreman nhe played mile on the tv show murphy brown nthis is definitely huge cast with some high profile name and it will definitely help it gross nof course you can probably tell where lot of the 60 million budget went to also ndirectors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomer though guterman did direct 1994 feature headless nbut both show an incredible talent for this type of picture ntense at time and very funny throughout the two hold this film together like professional nthe screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot but it contains lot of subtlety that make the film more suitable for adult nkids will delight in the animation while parent can laugh heartily at the humor nmost of it will go over young child head ndoes that mean you shouldn take kid to see it nnot at all nthey will have lot of fun watching this one nwhat is great is the theme that are given to u npart social commentary part romance story and part moral drama antz give everyone something to talk about whether it be the animation or the discussion of individualism and community nthankfully it not subtle in either aspect nantz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action nsometimes the language can be pushing the limit for family movie but the violence is what should keep kid at home nthe battle scene ha ant melting in acid and bug being speared to death nand the magnifying scene show an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight nbut other than that and some sexual innuendo it a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theater ni doubt many child will understand the sexual innuendo unless they are old enough but it still advisable to leave really young child at home nhave confused you enough nif you do take your kid recommend seeing the film with them because more than likely you ll enjoy it the most',\n",

been bad is richard linklater slacker dazed and confused before sunrise and suburbia all nwhich were great nnow adore quentin tarantino nhis first two film were classic film the second one being one of the greatest film of all time nbut 1995 just wasn that good of year for him nhe made way too many tv appearance nhe mispronounced jackie chan name on the mtv movie award nand he made this film he wa also awarded an oscar so guess that would be grand exception nrobert rodriguez is also great director not brilliant one but cool one ni ve never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film so

seen all of new york story but have heard the first two film by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap saw woody one which wa hilarious but not totally up to par but will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film nexposition simple one bellhop ted the totally overdone tim roth who a god and all but not in this one though he ha couple good moment is working on new year eve for his first shift in an old fancy hotel nhe the only one there again and he only ha couple room yet again nthe old bellhop the seemingly immortal marc lawrence who hated pulp fiction actually hand over his cap to ted and he go to his job happily na the night go on he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile nyea the short film are presented in order btw nthe missing ingredient writer director allison anders starring sammi davis amanda decadenet valeria golino madonna ione skye lili taylor alicia witt nthis one start it off horribly with no plot no intrigue and crap dialogue nthe situation is so terrible that it physically painful to watch nthe plot ha something to do with coven of witch needing sperm to bring back godess who is gasp nstuck inside some object in their hotel room nthe witch that wa supposed to bring it ione skye call up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it nyeah that what said nstupid plot inane character who aren interesting at all etc etc etc the only good thing about this is it ha good cast which in turn it waste pitifully nnot even actually funny for second nmy rating out of 5 no star nthe wrong man writer director alexandre rockwell starring david proval jennifer beals and laurence bender nanother bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on nted stumble into the wrong room or something and get in the middle of couple david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at coming back who are playing sex game nted try to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon nbut at least this ha bit of comedy in it just not that much nand david proval ha never overacted a much nand it pulp fiction producer laurence bender who get to puke from window na masterpiece compared to the first one but still nthe misbehavers writer director robert rodriguez starring antonio banderes tamlyn tomita lana mckissack danny verduzco salma hayek nwould robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek navel nnope nluckily she on the tv dancing so we get to see her nsurprisingly enough when read the screenplay about year before actually seeing it this one seemed to have the most potential nit wa fast paced funny and well funny nbut when watched it it seemed anti climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once nantonio overacts nicely and the two kid lana and danny are funny nbut a said it move slowly and in that way it more painful than funny nbut the ending wa stupid and funny at the same time noh nthe plot antonio is supposed gangster assumed really who leaf his two troubling kid home while he and his wife tomita go out to get drunk at new year party nantonio hire ted for couple buck to watch his kid all night long but thing go wrong it nwas okay nthe man from hollywood writer director quentin tarantino starring quentin tarantino bruce willis paul calderon and jennifer beals again nironically this one could be considered the best for bad reason it best represents what quentin ha done with this film nhe play chester spoiled brat actor or something who ha just had huge box office hit on his hand and is living it up by playing an anti climactic game from hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten time in row nthey re drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn light nthey also pay him lot of cash nthis is so much exactly what this little film is about that it campy ntim roth wa probably payed lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by bunch of people who are high on themselves cause they ve had hit major or minor nit took quentin to realize that nbut the thing is it doesn seem like he realizes that nif he did d give this good 3 star nbut this sucked nit wa anti climactic and the dialogue wasn very good nhe start off with very long steadicam shot then go to flash nthat make no sense nit cool for while then he make it uneven nit long and it just not very good nhopefully quentin never repeat what he did with this one nconclusion what the moral here nif you ve made celebrated film don do an ensemble piece nthey should have re watched new york story and then stopped in their track nnone of these have any point to them and they re embarrassing to not only the writer director but to the actor cause they re working with crap nbut will forgive everyone involved and especially look forward to quentin next directing job even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool from dusk till dawn which found exhilerating ni love quentin and suppose it good he made the man from

pathetic attempt to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him sometimes in most unusual circumstance like with secret service agent pimp or job interviewer make him person too

       " 'the thought provoking question of tradition over moral is the subject directly at the core of leila powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui that is his first motion picture in prosperous thirty year career to gain s distribution thanks to first run feature nalthough unfamiliar with mehrjui previous directing effort perhaps the reason for this is that while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to it own country the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotion of the character can easily be understood by all viewer nset in modern day iran leila begin on the birthday of the title character leila hatami after brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband reza ali mosaffa na leila and reza set off to visit his parent and then hers where birthday celebration ha been planned thing seem rosy for the couple on the outside but for leila life isn quite a sweet nearlier on that very same day leila had gone to see her physician and ha ultimately discovered that she hold very little chance of ever conceiving child nwhen all of the condition are ruled out and leila pass up the possibility of adoption reza firmly and lovingly tell her that he married her and doesn care at all about having child nnonetheless leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him baby which is the societal norm and her self esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother in law jamileh sheikhi whose hope to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news reza is her only son nbluntly explaining to leila that reza ha always wished for child and in country where polygamy is an accepted tradition she suggests that he take second wife to bear child with nleila hesitantly agrees and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful woman inadequacy reza finally doe meet woman whom he claim to like even though he refuse to go through with the marriage if leila doesn give her full blessing nthere are no easy answer to be found within leila film that thoughtfully examines the central character unfortunate plight a well a the inner working of leila herself told through matter of fact narration nalmost completely taken over by her own shame she ha no option but to agree to her forceful mother in law request even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really doe end up marrying another woman nmaybe because leila is from iran the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audience since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the character a more or le everyday occurrence nleila however is unable to come to term with the idea quite a easily but feel it is her duty to make her husband happy no matter what the circumstance none of the strongest aspect of the film is in it portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza who married only three month after their first meeting but obviously love each other very deeply nit is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scene all the more powerful and director mehrjui ha succeeded just about a well a possible nalthough seemingly unimportant at first glance an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing nearly uncontrollably actually is one of the most vital moment in the first half a it unmistakably set the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another nditto for another scene in which reza give leila large stuffed animal for her birthday and then reveals beautiful necklace he ha also gotten her nthese small moment are the perfect contrast for the solemn outraging sequence in the latter half in which reza drop leila off at the side of busy road and then zoom off to go on date with another woman nleft there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage foolishly unbeknownst to reza leila prays each time that the date will not go well so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for little while longer nrefusing to stay over at her parent house the film inevitably lead up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman and in sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency leila find her whole being emotionally torn apart a she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom a the marriage proceeding are going on down below ndespite her initial agreement to such thing leila realizes how much she ha been betrayed by reza whom she believed cared for her a much a she did of him nsure the whole second marriage wa his mother idea but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any child then he could have still easily backed out couldn he nin the pivotal role of leila who appears in every scene leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength unavoidable vulnerability and utter despair nunlike most american film in which everything always ha to be spelled out for audience hatami say much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by word nevery bit perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa a reza man who believe doe hold an unbreakable bond with his wife but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else nfor all of it strong aspect leila isn a perfect film non technical level found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistake within the subtitle that need to be fixed nand concerning the plot development the final five minute ring false when compared with everything that ha come before nmehrjui decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending wa the wrong choice particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother in law played memorably by jamileh sheikhi ndespite these minor misstep leila is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon it limited may 16 release at new york cinema village and then on may 21 in la nthe thought provoking question that the film deal with is balanced evenly with it uneasy morale and when the climax arrives leila self worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal victim led into complete devastation to which there is no return nit difficult to not consider how leila culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided had the other character taken second out of their own selfish life to consider what leila the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme wa going through',\n",

today most bankable star nbruce willis proved his acting chop and is now considered an actual actor njackie brown on the other hand boast quite well known cast except for the main lead pam grier nmost likely you have heard of her and seen her in film but she never really had breakthrough performance her first film wa in the roger ebert written beyond the valley of the doll nthat is until now njackie brown is highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino whose last film wa the huge hit pulp fiction nafter mediocre acting job tarantino return to what made his name household one directing and writing njackie brown is the result and it is fantastic entertainment ndespite excellent direction from tarantino the cast steal the film giving one good performance after another npam grier give stunning performance a jackie brown and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent samuel jackson bridget fonda michael keaton robert de niro and robert forster nmore than likely you will see few of these name in the oscar pool come oscar nomination ndescribing quentin tarantino film is very difficult a you really can say much or you spoil it for everyone else ni will tread lightly njackie brown open with an impressive shot of jackie brown grier in blue outfit walking through the airport nthe camera track along with her and end up revealing her occupation nwe are also introduced to ordell robbie jackson who sell illegal gun to interested buyer nfor hefty price nm brown carry the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cop away nhowever an fbi agent keaton and local a cop michael bowen are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money nthey try to reach him through beaumont livingston chris tucker one of ordell buyer but he mysteriously end up dead nthey try again through brown but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong doing nbut after unknowingly carrying some drug for one of ordell friend fonda she is caught and sent to jail nordell pay her bail through bail bond agent max cherry forster and then want to find out what she told the cop nafter she claim to have said nothing she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison nordell doesn like this but they both come up with scheme to throw the fed and cop off their track nthis scheme seems to be going a planned but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal nrevealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown and that the biggest reason to go see tarantino film ntarantino seems to have fascination with hitman and unusual predicament and slang term but they are always done very well and believably nhis hitman are normally cruel but pleasant in that nasty sort of way nthey talk like normal people except for when doing business and they are rude to their girlfriend nof course this is tarantino film and you know you can expect some awkward situation to arise nand perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begin to drop nof course tarantino fix this by moving onto the climax of the film adding lot of his reservoir dog style storytelling to it nthings are told from one person perspective and then from another and then from another each time learning more and more nthis all lead up to very interesting conclusion which decides who is on whose side non the technical side of jackie brown quentin tarantino directs it with the same style a he did with his 1994 film nhowever this time around it isn a nearly a impressive or original nthe writing on the other hand is quite good although do find tarantino use of slang term offensive nthe story jump back and forth in time a in pulp fiction but it much more easy to understand nhis previous film needed second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation but jackie brown is very simply to follow especially considering that the time is given during the leap in time nperhaps this is result of the screenplay being written from the novel rum punch by elmore leonard nthe dialogue is pretty much intelligent and all the character are fully realized nthe cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro who ha worked with tarantino on previous film and the editing is very good nand a with pulp fiction the music is highlight bringing back memorable song from the 70 and 80 nthe acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable nthe performance are incredibly rich with hidden meaning behind every character action nnothing is quite a it seems and you can really tell which side one person is on nthe real treat of course is pam grier who give an astonishing performance a jackie brown nher poor living condition are superceded by her superior wit which play an important role in the film nwatching grieg could tell what wa going through her mind even if didn know what she wa thinking nher face portrays lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad happy or in deep thought nbridget fonda give very good performance a druggie couch potato ni didn even realize it wa fonda until saw her name in the final credit her performance actually reminded me of heather graham in boogie night nmichael keaton come across very well a doe michael bowen nchris tucker ha small but effective performance nsamuel jackson is very good but it seems to me that he wa replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction although much le cynical nbut no matter njackson is very strong in his role nrobert de niro is actually little annoying at time but overall he doe good job a one of ordell perspective client and friend nrobert forster give one of the best performance in the film a he ha one of the most developed character nhe is present throughout most of the film and he hold his own against jackson and grier njackie brown is rated for language sex violence drug use and some offensive remark na film by itself jackie brown is terrific piece of entertainment with complex plot to draw viewer in nhowever one can not help but compare it to tarantino pulp fiction and expect great result nwhen compared it come up short but not that short nit a worthy effort with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino nperhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier a major hollywood actress ni can remember seeing her in anything

they had before nthis can easily stand a model for chocolat a whole on the surface it appears to be light fluffy fable with no depth or true worth but when one take second deeper look chocolat true color begin to shine through nmaking bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it lasse hallstrom chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted not to mention one of the best film of the year nwhat give chocolat it magic much like hallstrom 1999 winner of two academy award the cider house rule is it willingness to say what on it mind without holding back to prevent offending audience nthe bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage select group of viewer but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film say about narrow mindedness nchocolat center it story around the small french village of lansquenet where majority rule and the majority life by only one law religion nthe bulk of the townspeople with few exception are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence lent but when the independent thinking seemingly non religious vianne rocher juliette binoche and her daughter anouk victoire thivisol make the village their home the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth watering confection in the chocolate shop vianne open nmany are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent especially the mayor comte de reynaud cartoon like alfred molina who will stop at nothing to put her out of business non the other hand the shop is delight to others including the cranky armande voizin judi dench who sits day by day in vianne shop telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson aurelien parent koening which come a result of his mother carrie ann moss believing armande is bad influence a she doe not hold the same strict religious belief that she doe nalso fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat whose husband is constantly beating her to whom vianne offer home and befriends njuliette binoche is charming and honest a vianne genuinely capturing her character determination to turn the narrow minded townspeople into more happy independent human being but most of chocolat success is unquestionably result of the remarkable performance of the supporting actress nlena olin previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 deserves her second nomination for her earnest moving portrayal of lost scared woman torn between staying true to her battering manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs njudi dench is sharp incisive and occasionally greatly touching a armande voizin ncarrie ann moss in what is likely to be her first largely noticed and acclaimed role since the matrix show more solid side of her acting skill not previously seen crafting character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously nvictoire thivisol show much promise a anouk young girl hoping her always on the move mother will eventually settle down na trade ad for chocolat sum up best the power the actress have on screen with the tagline five extraordinary woman one extraordinary movie nthat not to say the men don do their share though alfred molina make for sly and utterly repugnant antagonist hugh conor add quite bit of comic relief a the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is and johnny depp give strong performance a the pirate roux who enters the film late in the game and spark the romantic interest of vianne nthe technical aspect of chocolat are strong across the board lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care perfectly balancing the element of each genre to be found within the film ncinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric fairy tale look to the film and rachel portman masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rule nchocolat adapted by robert nelson jacob from the joanne harris novel is wonderful little treat of film one that will most likely win over the heart of audience and the vote of academy member this winter and the aggressive backing of miramax film assures the latter nwhile not a powerful a the cider house

       " 'in the wake of the smashing success of rumble in the bronx it looking more and more likely that more jackie chan film will see american release nrumor ha it that one of these film will be drunken master ii nthe version have is copy from the laserdisc it widescreen and bilingually subtitled a are most hong kong film these day navailability over here in the united state is very limited these film must either be purchased via pirate or sought out from asian distributor such a tai seng nthe subtitling on the copy have is slightly hard to read the letter are white and bit small nalthough the american release will almost certainly be dubbed this review is of the subtitled version so please keep that in mind if you re reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it nto be fair must admit that ve never been very fond of period piece martial art movie the one set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past nperhaps it because most of those ve seen were filmed on inferior stock with either butchered dubbing or all but illegible subtitling or perhaps it because their plot all tend to be very similar to each other and in many case all but nonexistant nin fact many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only few minute before the end nor for that matter it might be because the jackie chan film with more modern setting armour of god rumble in the bronx etc tend to have more spectacular stunt often involving large motor vehicle and large explosion whereas period piece simply have the martial art nhaving said that must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is remarkable exception to all or most of the above is one of the better martial art film ve seen and quite enjoyed it nsurprised nwell so wa ndrunken master ii is about young man named wong fei hong played by jackie chan who is master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu nwhere he learned this style is uncertain a his father wong kei ying ti lung is steadfast in his opposition to fei hong practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu napparently fei hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore rather like paul bunyan is for american but ve heard very little about this and could quite well be wrong so ll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better none of my friend point out that the character of wong fei hong is also featured in the once upon time in china movie but have not yet seen those nthe plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy a are the plot to many such film but if you re watching jackie chan film odds are you aren expecting something on the order of war and peace nthe story seems to revolve around those evil foreigner who are spiriting away ancient chinese relic and hence china cultural heritage while overworking underpaying and beating up chinese worker in nearby steel mill nhowever this plot merely serf a framework for the other main story of the film fei hong perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend supplicate his father keep his pregnant mother played by anita mui from fighting and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thug nthe macguffin that drive the plot is precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigner nin the beginning fei hong accidentally steal it while trying to recover an identically wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father wa bringing back for customer nin the process he clash with another thief who is himself trying for the seal but end up instead with the ginseng nafter fei hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigner lackies thanks to some timely intervention by general son cameo appearance by andy lau who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei hong and his mother attempt to come up with replacement for the missing ginseng nand so it go nand the plot thickens later on such a when fei hong girlfriend maneuver him into kung fu match with rival or when fei hong and the thief now revealed to be loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigner are attacked en masse another grand kung fu movie tradition but think ve already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves nlet move on to the real draw of jackie chan movie the naction nthere plenty of martial art action to be found in this movie of ncourse in kung fu film that to be expected nhowever this isn just another kung fu movie this one ha jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography and jackie chan is genius nthe primary martial art style featured in the film is drunken boxing form of kung fu which attempt to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk nfurther for the purpose of this film at least drunken boxer fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated but nthere a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into stupor nunder normal circumstance the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid but jackie pull it off with flair nthe kung fu sequence are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper so ll just say that the fight especially the big climactic fight at the end in themselves make the movie worth watching nanother thing drunken master ii ha going for it is the stunt work neven without motor vehicle well not counting train there are some remarkable stunt in this film namong other thing jackie dive off balcony into table and crawl across hot coal not once but at _least_ twice if you count the outtake shown during the credit quicktime movie of these stunt can be found through the www movie database nunlike in american film these stunt are _not_ faked ndrunken master ii star several veteran actor of the hong kong movie scene including jackie ti lung better tomorrow 1 2 and anita mui the heroic trio series rumble in the bronx nthe performance are first rate especially when it come to the comedy part of the film nthe scene where fei hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei hong father back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious a is the scene where fei hong mother having just revealed that she is pregnant is threatening to hurt herself in order to draw her husband anger away from fei hong njackie ha developed his knack for physical comedy into sort of mastery over the year and he in fine form all through drunken master ii na far a cinematography is concerned it certainly work for this film nit nothing spectacular but is at least dozen time better than all those old kung fu movie of the 70 nthe picture is crisp and clear none thing find particularly worthy of mention is that at least in the copy have the screen wa wider than any film ve ever seen on videotape before almost whole 1 3 of the screen wa blocked out above and below watch this on bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can nit will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan and scanned for american video release ndrunken master ii show the full potential of period piece kung fu movie and it good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movie nthe plot doe meander bit but that to be expected in this type of film nif you like this kind of movie you ll love this movie and if not well give it chance anyway nif nothing else the

       " 'seen may 19 1999 at 5 m at the crossgates cinema 18 guilderland y theater 1 with my brother john for 8 50 theater rating excellent seat sound and picture critic note this review is the longest ve ever written and still only scratch the surface ni recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film a form of critical analysis na my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of the phantom menace how do even write this review nnever mind the fact that ve been waiting for new star war movie since wa seven year old nnever mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it wa even released nnever mind that there so much going on in this movie in term of plot action special effect and long term story that to analyze every aspect would take lot of time and energy and still wouldn cover everything nand also like ted doe in all of his review ll try to review this in way different from my usual review and instead write a casually a possible a if wa talking directly to you the reader nbefore we can begin analyzing the specific aspect of the film many of the most general and most significant factor must be considered to get the specific of the film skip this and the next four paragraph na ha been made obvious for the last several year another trilogy of film will be produced to account for the missing initial three installment of the star war series the first of the film wa actually episode four not one ngeorge lucas the creator of the series ha probably just assumed most people know the first produced trilogy star war the empire strike back and return of the jedi is actually the second trilogy chronologically nin medium interview in the past he ha explained why the movie were made out of order but can recall his reason nwith this new film he a writer and director ha also assumed viewer are at least vaguely familiar with the storyline and significant plot point of the first trilogy err nsecond trilogy nwell you know what mean nand in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant point must be mentioned which unfortunately may serve a spoiler so proceed with caution critic note 1 it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoiler because would like my review to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule ncritic note 2 reviewing this film also break the universal critic law of reviewing movie which a roger ebert coined it not what movie is about but how it is about it nbecause so many outside factor come into play in the film plot and significance a part of trilogy and just considering modern society it again would be difficult if not impossible to simply review the film a completely autonomous story nfirst of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it nwe know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker who will lead successful revolution against him and his empire nwe know obi wan ben kenobi wa the trainer of anakin in the way of the force in attempt to become jedi knight but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the dark side nwe also know something about the force itself that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose mind are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it the jedi nwhat we don know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth nto me this wa one of the most fascinating aspect of the first three film because there seemed to be subtle definite order to all the complexity nalso it seems that we re supposed to be familiar with few other detail about the story which have come out of the thousand of comic book and paperback published in the year since the movie ended nmost notably detail regarding the emperor from empire and jedi and that he wa once senator and his last name is palpatine nfor those who haven kept up with all the star war paraphernalia over the year there is still way to know these detail simply by recognizing an actor or his voice at least nwith the phantom menace being the first chapter of long saga one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid including the history behind all the major factor of the series especially the force and the jedi knight nunfortunately this film doe more of the opposite a it simply build on top of what must be history so long and detailed it could never be explained ni didn liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reason it fall just short of greatness nif you re going to tell story from the beginning tell it from the beginning is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episode 1 through 3 to clarify the back story even further nbut digress ni ve said so much and yet haven even touched on the specific of the film itself nall these necessary disclaiming element should go to show just how vast the story of the star war series is and this individual film itself nwhat we get here is movie not unlike any of the other three we ve come to know and love since the late 1970s nit similarity to the other film help to keep the spirit of the series familiar but at the same time seems to be flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes ring of unoriginality nthe basic story is rather sorted complex and even confusing at time nwe re told that an army known a the trade federation ha set up blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo nwe re not given too many detail to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is instead the film opts to get it story moving quickly nwe re introduced to two jedi the master qui gon jinni neeson and his apprentice obi wan kenobi mcgregor nthe two are acting a ambassador of some sort in hope of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet queen amidala portman nthe leader of the federation an alien called viceroy is following the order of strange mythical character an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wear nhe is referred to a lord sidious but considering his appearance and especially that creepy evil voice of his he is obviously one of the most significant character in the series nsidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmission and never in person nclearly his actual whereabouts are something he want to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity which is never openly revealed in the film but should be clear to most viewer ni have feeling we ll delve into his background in the next two film nbut it doesn take the film long to spring into action and within minute our hero jedi are fighting for their life and the film story begin to move along nthe film doesn have one specific plot and work in the same manner a the other film in the series where a what we get is one mini plot and adventure on top of another nthere are so many of these mini plot within plot in this film would not describe them all because it is what give the movie it hook nthe other film have relied on this type of storytelling but because of the limit of the technology at the time the film screenplay were also limiting nthe sense of limitlessness here is what give the phantom menace it unique trait na we already know the film take place at least generation or two before the original star war trilogy which mean lot of the background which wa unclear and or unexplained may be cleared up here a it is the beginning of the vast epic story nand here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10 year old anakin skywalker lloyd by qui gon jinni and his introduction to the jedi council nto briefly summarize the story jinni stumble upon skywalker in an attempt to buy part for queen amidala spaceship which wa damaged in effort to free her from the federation ntheir meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinni chalk it up to the will of the force njinn can feel that skywalker ha great natural power in the force and through another sub plot involving bet on skywalker in fantastic race he will enter more and more detail of his significance begin to reveal themselves nthis also provides for new elaboration and explanation of the force which ha never been mentioned before nin fact it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it ha never been mentioned before nthe element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary nby the film third act all the major significant element become tied together in rather familiar execution of the plot nit funny how the reality of the star war world seems so embedded in mythology new age like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflict in the series ha been violence nnot that this technique hasn been used in movie and in real life situation countless time throughout history nand at least it all in the spirit of the ultimate power of good versus evil in fun and exciting matter nit doe border of the cartoonish sometimes but that just the film appealing to our inner child which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and ha become such big part of our modern society the phantom menace delivers exactly what you expect from star war film which is why it succeeds a well a it doe but is always why it never truly achieves greatness nso many thing in the film we ve seen before and done with more heart because the filmmaker concentrated just bit more on story and character

picture nyou see patch adam revolted me beyond all boundary ni hated this movie for every second that sat watching it and actively hate it now day later with the simpering superficial nauseatingly sentimental image forever plaguing my memory ni hate every element of the film beginning with tom shadyac shameless direction and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled theme that the screenplay want so desperately to convey nthe badness of patch adam is stupefying nit confounding ni can believe film can be this bad nand yet it based on real man who probably ha good point to make nin the film patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams in performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that wonder now if he is even human nin the beginning of the film patch commits himself to mental institution because he doesn want to kill himself nwhile there he notice that the doctor don care about the patient and that the best way to get through to the patient is to treat them like human being nso patch go on crusade to be great doctor who actually talk to his patient nhe go to medical school where he meet truman daniel london and convinces him that it good to help people nhe also meet carin fischer monica potter the anti male med student who just want to go through the motion and be successful doctor nnaturally the dean of the medical school bob gunton hate patch and want to thwart his plan even though patch get the highest score on all of his exam nso patch decides that he going to build free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have nand that my friend is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 non superficial level the film is not particularly bad wouldn say the cinematography bothered me and most of the performance seem to be exactly what shadyac wa aiming for actually liked potter performance even if she is wasted nbut the film fails fundamentally in execution nevery scene swell with grand emotional music played at maximum volume just to get u all to cry real hard ntake for instance the first scene which show patch sitting on bus nwe don know patch yet but there sad music and it supposed to make u really sad that he sad nlater on patch make lot of progress he help dying patient peter coyote to enjoy the last day of his life and the music a patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the hall of the hospital is very lively nand when that patient finally dy spoiler alert the music is very very sad nbut the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotion nreal drama is character based nyou grow to like someone and then something bad happens and you feel it nwe don ever grow to know the dying patient he simply vehicle for patch greatness nreal drama doesn seem forced or present just to make the audience cry nthat why patch adam is not real drama nit go for every cheap tear imaginable wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene neven scene that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman sickening musical score nsentimentality like this is indeed bad nbut it not a bad a half baked simplistic theme nyou see patch is really great student nhe ace his test without studying and doe it so effectively that people think he cheating nbut patch doesn think that memorizing fact is the way to become good doctor why don we see patient until the third year he burst out every three second nwell patch that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patient nnot everyone ha the capability of memorizing fact with no effort nmost of u have to study nand doctor who really want to help but doesn know toe from finger probably won be too successful in preventing death noh wait almost forgot the point of doctor is not just to prevent death but to improve the quality of life nyes nthat is true nand you can not do that without studying nyou can not do that without going to medical school nwhat patch never seemed to understand wa the possibility that maybe just maybe it is good idea to study first and talk to patient later nfollow the rule nbah nwho need the rule nonly uptight doctor follow the rule nthe real savior are the one running around the hospital with big red sphere on their face and sporting baggy yellow pant nand then there the free clinic issue which find shockingly frighteningly idealistic na free clinic nin the middle of the forest nwhere patient can be taken to be helped nfor free nhow will patient be transported to the free clinic nwill it have an emergency room nor is it just for mental patient nand who may ask will pay for it nthe film doe give some token attempt to question patch motif think another character asks him how he going to pay for it in addition to little bit of meaningless blather about hmo and medical insurance but they certainly don explore or challenge patch idea to any meaningful extent nreader please understand this am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adam ni know nothing about him nif his belief mirror those of this film character then might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them nbut regardless of what the real patch adam belief the theme put forth in this film are simplistic and phony nand in the last scene the big obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus patch doe lot of shouting nactually robin williams doe lot of shouting

time ve seen anything funner nthe chicken at tweedy farm are up to something nliving in concentration camp like atmosphere they are led by one plucky hen called ginger voice of julia sawalha who continually come up with plan for escape and always get caught subsequently spending day after day in the coal box none night brash american rooster fly in over the fence calling himself rocky mel gibson famous flying rooster and circus performer nrocky promise to teach the chicken how to fly and the situation grows more desperate a the nefarious mr tweedy miranda richardson decides to abandon the farm egg selling plan for pie selling plan nshe order huge pie making machine cackling chicken go in pie come out nwhat sort of pie nchicken pie of course nco director nick park and his studio aardman animation produced three oscar winning short film creature comfort the wrong trouser and close shave nthe latter two were the second and third installment of trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventure npart of what made the wallace film brilliantly entertaining wa park uncanny ability to make an old story seem new the wrong trouser for example pulled out lot of old hitchcockian suspense trick and close shave owed great deal of inspiration to classic detective story nbut in the hand of park and his team the story felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived nnow teaming with co director peter lord park ha created similar creature in chicken run nthe plot is largely lifted from the great escape watch for quick reference to the ball bouncing scene with some spielberg inspired action sequence providing the excitement nthing is the film doesn feel like it been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feel fresh alive like nothing else ever done npart of it is the original idea who in the world came up with the idea to make prisoner of war movie starring chicken npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it worth the character treat their situation a if it were dead serious and to them it is nbut they re chicken so it funny to u nanother thing that help chicken run and most of park film succeed is the animator subtle way of giving nod to the very film they re cribbing nthere are reference to the great escape obviously and stalag 17 nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parody both raider of the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple of doom nthere even nod to the blue brother if you can believe it and the filmmaker even get in little light hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor taking couple of very subtle jab at mel gibson nationality and film history nthe braveheart reference is hoot if you catch it nwhen you consider just how fine line resides between funny parody and redundant one chicken run is downright brilliant in it execution nconsider this since july of last year ve seen dozen upon dozen of blair witch project parody on television on the radio and online nout of all those maybe one or two were amusing the rest tiresome nwhy nbecause once you got past the thought that they re parodying that blair witch movie most of the parody had nothing to offer no insight no original idea no greater purpose nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing nconversely chicken run doesn lean on it parody the film reference are never the sole focus of any scene nif you ve never seen indiana jones the chase sequence is still fun neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is rocky remains an interesting character npark lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience doe not need parody shoved in their face before it understood and a result chicken run is filled with visual and verbal jab that are never too obvious but not quite vague either nenjoyment of this movie doesn require knowledge of film history but if you ve got it chicken run is that much richer nthe voice cast turn in uniformly lively performance and the character they play are given so many subtle nuance that it hard not to fall in love with every one of them nginger is perfect spunky and opinionated but with soft heart that forbids her to leave her companion behind and julia sawalha known a the cute mousy girl on absolutely fabulous nail it nshe ha warm human chemistry with gibson whose rocky hide his personal doubt under brash gung ho veneer nthe character inevitable romance doesn feel contrived but sweet npoor mr tweedy tony haygarth suspect the chicken are organizing in some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring thing out and his overbearing wife certainly isn any help njane horrocks delivers lovely voice characterization a tragically optimistic babs hen that run away with most of the best one liner all while perpetually crocheting sweater and two supply trading rat that seem to have walked straight out of monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing dancing sequence nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that baffled scholar and theologian alike for decade the chicken v egg dilemma none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off a wearisome but a with most of chicken run it come a delightful surprise nthe film manages to cross all barrier it should be accessible to both child and adult brit and yank rat and chicken nthe animation is first rate nremember that this wa all done the old fashioned way with actual human moving clay figurine around on tiny set bit by painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really is nthis movie posse that same quality that make pixar studio animation great precise and unwavering attention to detail na in such top notch family fare a bug life or toy story 2 chicken run ha something to offer in nearly every frame ncertainly passive viewer can enjoy it a straightforward story with worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scene but active attentive viewer will enjoy it even more because they ll catch all the detail nanyway the movie just boatload of fun nfunnest damn movie ve seen all year',\n",

       " 'here is film that is so unexpected so scary and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for loop nokay it isn quite original considering it is sequel to the box office hit specie but it certainly is smart nmost film of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy horror film from the 50 and 60 and some even become them nhowever a we learned with the 1995 small budget horror sci fi film sometimes expectation can be shattered na lot of criticism ha gone against this film from what have read so far anyway yep all two review and it make me wonder why these type of film are automatically dismissed a gory laughable piece of trash nbut the thing is it isn nit well made well acted and quite intelligent ni can see most of the critic now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film nbut the specie series isn about the lack of these element nit about how much it can get into one film nand yet behind it all it ha this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so nspecies ii begin in the present day though it seems to be an alternate universe nmany film especially sci fi one create similar timeline a our realistic one but change it to fit the film need nspecies ii begin with the arrival of an american spacecraft the excursion landing on the surface of mar naboard is patrick ross justin lazard very bright and very handsome astronaut npatrick is the son of senator ross james cromwell who just want patrick to succeed nwell it would seem that he ha succeeded nlanding on the surface of mar he is the first human being to ever do so nof course he isn the first ever nabout billion year ago an alien specie supposedly landed on mar and destroyed the perfect living condition that were able to sustain life nnow of course the red planet is cold and rocky nno life life on it nthat is no visible life npatrick upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil collect sample from the ground nhe take them aboard and put them in storage nunfortunately one of the sample contains form of life and it get loose when it is heated aboard the ship njust prior to heading back to earth this life form creep along the floor and inhabits the earthling nthey pas out for approximately seven minute and then shrug it off a nothing because they can even remember nthey blame it on technical malfunction nback on earth patrick begin to have strong urge to mate with a many woman a possible na we know from the original this is because the alien want to breed and take over the planet nhowever the child that are bred are half human a their father is npatrick is really looking for another alien to breed with and he find it in eve natasha henstridge neve wa cloned from dna taken from sil the original alien nhowever this time around most of her alien urge have been either decreased dramatically or lie dormant nthe project is led by dr laura baker marg helgenberger reprising her role from specie and her motif seem respectable nsince she wa involved with the original alien attack she want to learn how to stop the alien should it come again nand it ha nstory wise specie ii is much stronger than it predecessor but it is also much stronger than say alien hey love the film but you can tell me it wa strong on story nwhat surprised me the most with this film wa the incorporation of historical fact into the screenplay nin my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college we learned about piece of rock from mar which landed in one of the pole nthis piece of rock contained fossil which may have been proof of life on mar later it wa proven that it wa not living creature that created it nthe script us this effectively but also manages to provide well balanced plot nbeginning with the first man on mar something have always dreamed of seeing wa hoping that the film would turn this element into useful starting point for the movie nand it doe it quite well nthe character are all smart and they know what to do and what not to do nthe only character that seems little cliched is the general george dzundza and yet he remains logical in everything he doe nthere are the obvious flaw of course mostly lying in the technical aspect nthe special effect are only mediocre and some are just plain bad nbut for the most part they remain believable even noticed homage to the alien series when the mother gave birth to alien child nalso the most realistic one are usually the goriest ranging from people being torn open or someone head being blown off nhowever some plot element also may elicit laugh from the audience including menage troi that is all but necessary nmany people dislike the specie series because all it is is an excuse for sex nudity and gory violence nhowever tend to disagree nwhat were the alien film about nand if an alien specie ever did come to earth and their sole purpose wa to destroy u wouldn you mate a quickly a possible with a many people a possible nmy only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick go searching for mate in grocery store ni didn realize that alien were that picky on choosing woman to mate with just assume it is his part human side looking for the most beautiful one nthe acting is quite good for this kind of film nit is vast improvement over the first film at least nthe acting is the key element to this film if it wa bad it would have lowered itself into camp if it wa good it would have asked for comparison with film like alien nokay so it isn that good ngeorge dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting a his over the top impersonation of general make him annoying and distracting nnatasha henstridge is limited this time around a she is usually enclosed in cage nhowever she doe manage very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent noh yeah and she quite fun to just plain watch nmarg helgenberger is immensely better this time around and her performance is probably the best in this film nmichael madsen is so so but he isn annoying and he soon becomes rather appealing with his nice cynic personality njames cromwell ha small part but he make it much better than what it could have been with more incapable actor na say any film with james cromwell dramatically increase in likeability nmykelti williamson give an enjoyable performance and he give the film more down to earth feel nand of course justin lazard nlazard ha so far been ridiculed for his performance but think he is effective nsure he is wooden but isn that what his character is like nthe moment when he touch the glass separating henstridge from him wa extremely well done due to the couple acting nspecies ii is rated for strong sexuality sci fi violence gore and language nthis is definitely an rated

are often at stake and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable prone to turn on the negotiator at moment notice nthe negotiator must therefore be something of an actor psychologist and sham artist in addition to being police officer he must be able to think on his foot and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence or failing that must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower nmost of all the negotiator must be able to enter situation with a little intelligence about the scenario a possible and quickly gain control of the situation dominate the conversation and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really want nit take pretty smart person to do that nbut what if the hostage holding criminal is just a smart nwhat if he also able to think on his foot nin fact what if he also know all the trick to turning the situation to his favor nit is this circumstance which form the basis for gary gray the negotiator nin this film police negotiator danny roman samuel jackson is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force nwhen his partner turn up shot to death and internal affair find incriminating evidence in roman home roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder nfaced with the scorn of most of the police department and under close scrutiny by the medium roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scene in the captain office ni don quite remember if the captain actually said hate to do this but nalthough it wouldn surprise me if he did nluckily the film soon shake off the conventionalism and concentrate on the interesting premise mentioned above nafter being offered take it or leave it deal by the district attorney roman resolve to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affair inspector niebaum t nwalsh taking him and others hostage and proclaiming he ha been framed nalthough roman action seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build up gray redeems himself by involving u with the negotiation between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian kevin spacey which soon ensue njackson while superb actor is miscast in the role of roman nthe actor ha become so popular and so often identified a protagonist notable exception can be found such a in jackie brown that we a an audience have difficult time believing he will carry out his threat nthe script also clearly set him up a the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence nhow can we believe he going to shoot hostage no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier nunfortunately this preconception sap the film of some of it would be suspenseful moment and anything good left in those scene is largely attributed to jackson acting ability nalmost every time he in scene jackson steal it without looking back nwhen spacey appears the film ha already run about third of it course nhis is an interesting character nmade out to be some kind of negotiating superman our first look at him ha him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation i can talk man out of blowing up the sears tower but can talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone he say nwhen he get the call to action however he quickly change gear and becomes the man we expect him to be nsoon his character ha to negotiate not only with roman but also with the swat commander david morse who is itching to send in team to take roman out all the while keeping wary of the fbi agent who are waiting to take over the operation should negotiation fail nthis complex set of pressure are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor na the second protagonist spacey measure up nicely ngray really lucked out with this cast ndavid morse a commander beck ron rifkin a commander frost and john spencer a police chief al travis are all more than competent and can hold their own in scene with jackson and spacey nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that result from these choice morse played similar role in the rock rifkin played the a nin a confidential and spencer played police detective in cop land nwith the level of acting however this can be forgiven nalso in the supporting cast paul giamatti a rudy one of the hostage is notable for the comic relief he provides nhis character is initially so slimy and giamatti himself just look so shifty that you expect to laugh before he even say anything nfortunately this doesn distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film but instead provides some nice breather from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout nj walsh a the suspicious internal affair inspector clock in with one of his final performance nsadly the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film nwalsh appeared in dozen of movie such a good morning vietnam backdraft and nixon nfor one of his best performance check out sling blade in which he play mental patient sharing ward with billy bob thornton nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march walsh wa one of the men to whom he credited his success the actor performed together in few good men nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing nin the end the negotiator ha plotline that parallel it reality nwe re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiator are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best na an audience we re also given situation where two wonderfully talented actor are thrown into movie and we like to see if one will

nthe salute is rendered by the highest ranking individual present when the superior officer come within six pace of the detail and is dropped when the officer pass six pace from the detail nin any event the salute is rendered only by the man or woman in charge rather than by the whole group nalmost at the very beginning of the general daughter we see general motorcade passing work detail neveryone salute nit looked impressive but it just wasn right nthat little bit showed me that someone either didn do the appropriate research or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene nin fact this would serve a metaphor for the rest of the picture a it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to good movie nwhat result is film that look good but like that one scene just isn right nthe first fifteen minute of the film is good example npaul brenner john travolta is an agent for the army criminal investigation division undercover at georgia army base to investigate an illegal arm sale nprior to the transaction the buyer get whiff that brenner isn the unscrupulous supply sergeant he supposed to be and later that night attempt to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living nso ensues cat and mouse action sequence which end like certain scene in raider of the lost ark we ll just say that it involves propeller nbrenner then receives new order when the commanding general daughter captain elisabeth campbell leslie stefanson is found naked bound and dead on one of the base training range nhe is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill madeleine stowe to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder nwhat want to know is why the whole action scene with the arm buyer wa even necessary nit give no insight into brenner other than the fact that he a little cocky ndoes the arm subplot turn up later nno so why add this extra running time to the film nthe answer it looked cool nor how about the atmosphere nthe beginning of the general daughter present u with imagery of the deep south thick tree dirt road sultry color over water all backed up with bayouesque music nnice immersion in the setting but it soon doesn matter for when the film plot shift over to the murder investigation so doe the entire mood nno attention is paid to the location of the story and the music is altered to fit very generic thriller theme ndid the filmmaker start out thinking they were making different movie ninstead of creating cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside nthe above example also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie na ve already mentioned an entire section of the film doesn jibe with the rest and the characterization only add to the difficulty nbrenner who come across a man with little respect for authority suddenly snap to in the presence of general campbell james cromwell and utters some of the corniest yes sir i ve ever heard nhe even delivers an emotion charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general daughter even though he wa totally flippant about the whole thing just couple of minute previous nsunhill who initially come across a professional investigator utilizes couple of blatantly illegal method to obtain information and even revel in her ingenuity nboth character are protagonist but it hard to get behind them when their personality are all over the place and in some case simply unappealing ni could imagine that during filming west would shoot scene then take the actor aside and tell them let do it again but this time want more ni say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good in this film they overact in most of their scene nan even worse offender is clarence williams iii a the general aide colonel fowler ni swear the guy say all of his line from the position of attention na far cry from his day a linc in the mod squad can help but think he wa acting from west direction na couple of side character including west point psychologist john beasly and young female private ariyan johnson make their scene nearly impossible to bear nthe only two actor who seem to have escaped west influence are james wood who provides good performance a colonel moore elisabeth mentor at the psychological operation unit and timothy hutton a colonel kent of the military police nwoods relish the role of man whose job is playing with people mind and doe so without ever taking it over the top nhutton just kind of hang around but at least he wasn overacting ni haven read the nelson demille novel on which this movie wa based but ll bet more than few dollar that the story wa better in book form nthe movie version ha got character which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space or provide bit of information which seem to neither mean anything in term of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished nevery time we re presented with some new aspect to the case west give u more of that flash by playing it up like it the most momentous discovery ever but the information is not used by the investigator at all ninstead when conclusion are drawn they are such tremendous leap of faith that you wonder if successful investigation are not based on fact but lucky guess instead nthe army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill letting them play game of twenty question with the suspect then letting them guess who the killer wa nwould ve been over in half hour nthe film finish with sort of bookend featuring the same style and southern scenery a the very beginning nliterally during the closing credit we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off nthey both seem kind of happy nmaybe they were driving away from simon west',\n",

       " 'it seemed like the perfect concept nwhat better for the farrelly brother famous for writing and directing comedy with offensive subject matter than to make movie about guy with split personality nit exactly the sort of thing the brother relish poking fun at something serious in this case mental illness throwing all care to the wind to get laugh njim carrey signed on too neven better nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaint against the brother new film before it opening claiming it wa misrepresenting the condition of split personality labeling it incorrectly a schizophrenia and so forth nsuch protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would of course only add more fuel to the farrelly brother fire proving that some people just couldn take joke and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewer to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy nyes it all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie isn funny nit not for lack of trying nthe farrellys utilize in me myself irene their most high concept premise ever carrey play charlie baileygaites man who after being dumped by his wife for midget limo driver decides to bury all his aggressive feeling deep down inside and never release them nthis of course mean all his neighbor exploit his entirely too forgiving nature making his job a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult nsoon enough charlie repressed aggression manifest itself into second independent personality named hank deep voiced boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive action his predecessor had been unable to muster nthis guy isn above crashing car through the wall of the barber shop in which he been insulted or holding little girl head underwater because she refused to stop jump roping in the street nthen thing start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the film run off it track nsome have suggested that this isn a problem because the farrelly brother brand of humor doesn require plot to work nthey re wrong of course plot wa greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort 1996 there something about mary 1999 outside providence wa technically an earlier project nthe brother earlier film wasn funny merely because it contained outrageous gag despite what some newsmagazine article would have you believe but rather because it most outrageous gag were entirely unexpected nin mary the farrellys managed several time to pull off neat sleight of hand trick they have you thinking the story wa going one way then reveal it real direction in delightfully surprising fashion me myself irene by contrast seems to have been made by folk who looked at mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all of the subtle machination that really made it work nhaving been produced by the same guy who made mary irene seems like an even bigger disappointment nthe brother pile on the offensive humor taking shot at race midget albino mental illness and all manner of bathroom joke nbut they haven come up with way to make any of it fresh most of me myself irene come off a rote by the number adolescent comedy nthe plot with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene water renee zellweger who in more trouble than anyone know back to new york ha an ending that entirely predictable from the get go think charlie and irene will fall in love nyeah me too nthe farrellys then introduce score of different character and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven already expected them to do no matter how outrageous their action might be ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing this stuff is almost entirely soft tossed presenting an obvious problem when gross out humor loses it shock value it no longer funny merely gross nthe joke that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness run dry ntake for example the subplot involving charlie three black son anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon nthe incongruity of it all is funny for while with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too pleasant smile on his face nbut by the end of the film they re still doing the same schitck it hasn been elevated to another funnier level and it hasn been dropped either nthat too bad because it cease to be amusing about halfway through me myself irene reek of wasted opportunity nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie new personality and on how charlie deal with the consequence of hank action nthis doesn really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie condition early on so they don have any opportunity to be surprised by it nthe film throw what look like patented farrelly curve in scene towards the midway point involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called appropriately whitey but the script doesn go anywhere with it instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax njim carrey is gifted comedian both physically and vocally but he left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in manner similar to steve martin in all of me nit a great showcase of flexibility and split second role shifting but none of it is terribly funny ncarrey doesn pull any stunt we don expect him to pull and the farrellys script doesn give him anything else to pull the situation in which he must perform the role shifting aren set up in any meaningful way nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actor fare no better nzellweger irene is not strong female lead mary in mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she wa also intelligent and strong willed nirene is nothing in particular a the film never make clear whether she ditzy clever or neither na such she give u nothing to latch onto a the only sane person in the film nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note a corrupt fbi agent and his character is entirely too straight laced for movie like this nhe like the others doe absolutely nothing unexpected nafter viewing the shapeless mess that me myself irene eventually dissolved into wa stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audience get wise to it and stop being shocked nbut don believe it good filmmaker find way of surprising their audience even after people have grown attuned to their style nif the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmaker and still think they are they ll rebound just fine neven after that happens though ll still consider me

not very prevalent in movie today inundated a we are with film which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator nyou will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brook film while the dialog will not be a oppressive a in some of the independent talk film which are finding their way into theater nthe situation in which his character find themselves are one we can often identify with but even if we can brook ha the talent to make them comfortable and therefore we laugh nteenagers and jim carrey fan probably won find an albert brook movie very funny but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will nput simply brook comedy is intelligent nmother is albert brook latest film and it doe not disappoint nbrooks play john henderson middle aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce nhe make an attempt at dating but fails miserably nhe then ha dinner with his brother jeff rob morrow successful sport agent who seems to live the ideal life njeff ha good job loving family and most of all warm relationship with their mother beatrice debbie reynolds nafter dinner john witness telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky dory the dialog is nin comparison beatrice always hint at fault in john and his career every time she talk with him and john give it right back to her nat the end of one of their conversation where beatrice ha just picked apart john life she say love you and john reply with know you think you do nthe thing is beatrice is not overt with her criticism but instead give them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit picking and guilt loading nit the kind that go something like yes dear think you do that wonderfully but nit seems a though nothing he doe make her happy nthere always the big but njohn belief that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationship with woman either because of his flawed self esteem caused by his need for validation or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out woman who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner nhe come to the conclusion that since his problem are rooted in his boyhood home he should move back in with his mother for while just to see what kind of feeling come out and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is a great experiment he call it nbrooks own brand of humor really shine in this film especially in the interaction john ha with his mother nthere a scene where john ha just arrived at his mother house and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito and having explained to his mother about the great experiment beatrice asks now explain to me again why you don want to stay at hotel nshe still doesn get it and it is absolutely hilarious nin the same scene we get little glance at the life his mother lead when she try to feed him food that is no longer fresh nshe apparently buy in great quantity and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over nwhen john point out the ice on the sherbet beatrice tell him not to worry about the protective glaze you ve named the ice nasks john nhe also surprised at the variety of item beatrice keep in the refrigerator such a twenty pound block of cheese the freezer wa good invention say john but it not supposed to be used for everything nthat why it smaller than the refrigerator nit something most of u find strangely familiar nbrooks is also master at employing the non sequitur nfor example in defending your life his and meryl streep character are in comedy club having discussion nwhen they re finished and walk out brook cut to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line and so the moral is if you have to fart go outside nyou don know what the joke wa because you couldn hear him during the entire scene but must have laughed for the next five minute it seemed so out of context nin this film brook us the same trick couple of time to open or close scene ni don want to give them away but suffice it to say they work just a well a they have in the past njohn purpose for staying with his mother is to learn and we a the audience learn right along with him nhis mother is not the fascinating type to begin with but a john spends more time with her we learn thing about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth nwatching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit a enjoyable a the humor that accompanies it each step of the way non screen brook doe an excellent job playing this kind of character you get the feeling he often belief he is the only sane person in an insane world nin way he very much like yosarian of catch 22 expect with something of an attitude ncasting debbie reynolds a beatrice is perfect nshe assumes the part with ease even moving and speaking little slowly and is just so adorable it hard to get mad at her character nthis only help the audience to share the frustration john feel when dealing with her na his first choice brook originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband who wa beginning to show symptom of alzheimer disease nthat may be just a well since reynolds lends softness to the character which enhances it immensely nrob morrow also doe good job at playing the younger brother who ha always been mother favorite and for all his success in his job and family is slowly exposed a mama boy nthe only thing that hold this movie back from being better are couple of plot hole na solid connection is not really made between john trouble and his reason for living with his mother nadditionally the end result of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goal and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this nbeatrice you must think m some kind of moron njohn no think your someone who think m moron nbeatrice well it take one to know one',\n",

       " 'after hearing review for woody allen upteenth movie in history celebrity range from terribly boring to just so so my heart lept when the opening image of the film closely resembled that of manhattan my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time nwoody allen film almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair so when one of his film closely resembles the one time that these two entity fit hand in hand manhattan really is one of the best looking film ve ever seen beautiful black and white photography of the city best area etc fan can help but feel visibly moved nthe film open up with the usual credit with plain white font over black background and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack but then the screen fill with gorgeous dull gray sky with the word help being spelled with an airplane nbeethoven 5th blast on the soundtrack nthe city seems to stop to take notice of this moment and it all rather lovely to look at nand then we cut to film crew shooting this a the film hilariously banal key moment in the film where the lead actress in the film melanie griffith looking a buxom and beautiful a ever ha to realize something wrong with her life or whatever nit a terribly stale scene for woody allen film with the great opening shot or without and my heart sank and soon got used to the fact that once again new film of his wa not going to be a great a his past work though for the record last year deconstructing harry came awfully close nwhat the hell ha happened to him nthe man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema ha not become le funny but his film have become le insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished idea bullet over broadway though wonderful relies on irony to pull farce that just never totally take off mighty aphrodite is more full of great moment and line than really great story everyone say love you wa more of great idea than great film neven deconstructing harry is admittingly cheap in way even if it doe top a one of his most truly hilarious film nif anything the reception of celebrity by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time it not the audience and critic who are wrong about how wonderful his film is it him celebrity is yes good film but it only marginally satisfying a woody allen film ninstead of creating the great woody allen world he created world out of subject he know only bit about nand he fashioned film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrity so that it play like series of skit with minor connection nit like la dolce vita without the accuracy the right amount of wit and the correct personal crisis nwoody becoming more insecure in his old age choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrity and then hang him and all his flaw up for scrutiny and doe this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead nmuch ha been said about his performance dead on but irritating make one yearn for the real thing blah blah blah but to anyone who actually know the woody allen character know that branagh performance though featuring some of the same mannerism stuttering whining lot hand gesture is hardly wart and all impersonation nbranagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm which actually allows for his character flaw to be more apparent nwoody a flawed guy and we know it but we love him anyway because he really funny and really witty and really intelligent nbranagh allen is bit more flat out bad but with the same charm so that yes we like him but we re still not sure if he really good person or not nhis character lee simon is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie hit on extra actress winona ryder then go off to interview griffith who take him to her childhood home where he make pas at her and she denies him sorta nwe then learn through flashback that lee ha been sucked into trying to be celebrity thanks to mid life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion nhe ha since quit his job a travel journalist and become gossip journalist of sort covering movie set and place where celebrity congregate so that he can meet them and maybe sell his script bank robbery movie but with deep personal crisis na such he ha divorced his wife of several year allen regular judy davis and continues on quest for sexual happiness boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film nafter griffith come his escapade with model charlize theron who is polymorphously perverse glad to see allen is using new joke ha ha who take him for wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of la dolce vita nfollowing are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen relationship that almost assures him success and his continued escapade with ryder whom he fancy most of all nhis story is juxtaposed with that of davis who flip out but stumble onto happiness when she run into handsome friendly tv exec joe mantegna who land her job that furthers her career to national status nwhile lee is fumbling about selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness davis becomes happy ve become the kind of woman ve always hated and ni loving it nwithout doing thing nthe result is film of high and medium nthe medium are what take up most of the film with sitations and scene which don exactly work but you can help but pat allen on the back for trying nbut other place are really great scene nthe opening nthe sequence with theron which is so good that wished it hadn ended na banana scene with bebe neuwirth droll a ever nand perhaps the best sequence romp with hot a hell teen idol brandon darrow played by none other than leo dicaprio who is so un dicaprio esque that if any of this fan could sit through this film they never look at him the same way nhe ignites the screen with intensity and spare nothing in showing his character a narcissistically tyrannical and totally heartbreaking for lee who come to him to talk about his script that he ha read and find himself on wild all day ride with him nthey go to atlantic city to watch fight they gamble and they wind up in his hotel room where darrow get it on with his flame gretchen mol and he lends him one of the leftover groupie nallen writing in these scene are so good that just for them d almost recommend the film nalmost nbut what really liked about this film is despite the fact that it a mess despite the fact that what this film really need is good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself it still smart and insightful film nthough some of the joke are either stale or misplaced some seem too cartoonish even for this environment allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrity a it may seem to be if it were it be extremely out of touch but about those who want to be celebrity and how they equate celebrity hood with happiness nwe never get close enough to the actual celebrity to see if they re really happy they may appear to be on the surface but we do get close enough to lee and davis character nlee is obsessed with the phenomenon while davis take is at arm length and never get too involved in what it is and soon becomes one herself nbesides it witty and it doe have the one thing that no other film ha but allen that great woody allen feel nit may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in it depiction of it subject and yes a part of woody allen oeuvre it merely blip no annie hall but it no shadow and fog either but it go to prove that no one can make film like him and only he and maybe godard could possibly take totally horrible metaphor like the one in the beginning and make it work not once but twice',\n",

stimulating theme into the lavish high concept on which he toil nstarship trooper wa essentially b monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange great film that nearly impossible to find on video yet showgirl is everywhere in which he cast troop of stunningly attractive mannequin the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards who may actually be 45 silicone in what feel like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scene of graphic carnage nit not completely successful film but a failure it certainly an interesting and mostly entertaining one nmy favorite verhoeven film were the one he made before he hit our shore spetters dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange haven yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight ni believe his best hollywood film to be robocop bleak super hero satire with robotic hero that a touching a schwarzenegger in t2 nthat movie wa violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pic nit violence seemed to be there for purpose namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience nthere a jaw dropping scene within the first ten minute of robocop wherein the lead villain toy with cop before snuffing him nhe torture the officer by taking glee in his victim every fearful tic nit a startling moment of barbaric maddening violence that effectively set the tone for the film that could be designated a splatter punk noir nin hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays dog because it just won shut up he impales co worker drowns another and so on nbut why nhis character is introduced a smug genius the kind who always impeccably dressed

have labored insult become big budget hollywood new character developing technique nahh what cynical time we live in na the picture open we meet cain kevin bacon an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientist on top secret so top secret the government ha only provided them with dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation project with the goal to make invisibility possibility for what purpose is never hinted at nthey ve performed several experiment on animal and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine in twist worthy of the film 1950 late show origin to impulsively experiment on himself ncaine neglect to let the pentagon in on his plan and somehow get two of his co worker to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead nour mad scientist is turned invisible after several fx heavy complication then he inexplicably it hinted that the process of invisibility ha made the animal into more savage creature but this is never explored and if that wa the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on human nbegins raping assaulting and murdering anyone he plea always with lame wisecrack ready la freddy krueger nit grows abundantly clear with each new release that it verhoeven film that have become hollow nlike the rest this one is cold heartless and full of contempt for humanity but in addition to all that it lack any trace of wit insight and make no statement other than audience will pay for anything these day nit an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level or even those hoping to spend saturday night with fun thrill minute ride nverhoeven ha instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care nthe preview make hollow man look like an irresistible flick nhow can one not have good time at film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self na couple week ago after seeing the trailer bunch of friend and got into long discussion of how invisible man flick never go so far a to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability nhollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa in serious manner to boot nbut oh yeah it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway nverhoeven delivers the sleazy good but not in watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner here it just feel icky and uncomfortable nthe director keep his camera trained at his nubile actress caressing their breast with his lens all while faux psycho music strain in the background nit plainly obvious that verhoeven isn exploring voyeurism like in the classic peeping tom but exploiting it and not even doing that very well nit funny that with all the technology 90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show woman naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand nmost vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply a gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein character do stupid thing just so the villain can pop up for more attack nin fact it largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since by the end most of his potential victim don infer red glass that track his body heat na in every mad slasher film we get the killer pov scene where he spy on his neighbor while she undress triggered unpleasant memory of slumber party massacre and lot of scene where people are unknowingly stalked nthe film only provides one moment that found genuinely creepy nit happens when lab assistant kim dickens who look like she stepped out of playboy in the middle of chit chat with an invisible bacon suddenly pause are you looking at me she query obviously haunted nit a little moment in big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effect set to plot that should have run it course by 1982 the apex of the mad slasher craze nthose

film look good ni happy to say that there something about mary is not one of those trailer let down nin fact watching this film wa quite fine way to spend two hour nthe film open up in flashback to 1985 at high school in cumberland rhode island nted stroehmann ben stiller is social reject who can seem to get date to the upcoming prom until he come to the defense of the mentally retarded warren nearl brown who being harassed by one of the school jock nit seems warren sister is the campus queen mary jensen cameron diaz who is impressed with ted willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother despite very real chance of getting beaten up nmary take an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom nted wa just flattered that she even knew his name nunfortunately prom night is ruined when ted ha an accident with his zipper at which every man in the theater will wince and is sent to the hospital nfast forward to the present where ted ha cleaned himself up now writes for magazine but ha weekly therapy session in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 year mary whom he hasn seen since that fateful day nwith the help of his friend dom chris elliott ted hire slimy private investigator pat healy matt dillon to track down his only love nhowever when pat find mary he fall for her too and soon the both of them are competing for her affection nthere something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly who brought u dumb and dumber and kingpin nnot exactly intelligent comedy they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friend or co worker to think you had such great time watching them nwith their current film the farrelly brother have come up with something you ll not only enjoy but also won mind talking about the next day at the water cooler nthe film succeeds in employing pretty wide range of comedic style from the subtle to the ridiculous and while few of the gag might be offensive to some seeming like residual from the farrelly brother last two film they almost all work ni have not seen many movie in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on none minute you ll be laughing at something ted say and the next you ll be howling at the sight of dog dragging him across the floor of mary apartment none of the great thing this film ha going for it is ben stiller nhe is perfectly cast in the role of ted because he a guy who just look awkward in almost every situation nted a nice fellow and try to do his best but for some reason or another thing just don always work out nit comical but also ha that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top nactually ve liked stiller since he did short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid eighty nthe film wa like theatrical trailer for spoof on the tom cruise paul newman film the color of money entitled the hustler of money nin it stiller played wince not vince who is taken under the wing of an older man played by john mahoney to become big time bowling hustler nit wa parody at it finest more of which showed up in the short lived the ben stiller show on the fox network in late 92 early 93 nlike the critic which aired on abc then fox still mourn that show cancellation ncameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she date and some of the quality she look for make mary look paper thin at time nhowever diaz pull the role off with such panache and charm that you can still see why she got guy just falling over each other to be with her nheck even found her laugh to be cute even though thought it wa annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week nmy girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn change and you know it really true nhe and ralph macchio must hang out or something nmaybe they live in dick clark pool house nanyway here another good piece of casting a dillon slip beautifully into the role of the guy who try to worm his way into mary heart nthe supporting performance are also good nchris elliott ha bigger part than in the abyss yes check it out next time and le annoying than in cabin boy nlin shae who play mary neighbor magda and also appeared a the landlady in kingpin provides some good laugh especially in scene with her benji like dog which act a the focal point for few of the funniest moment of the film nlee evans a mary friend tucker display flexibility in acting and accent which surprise and contributes to an interesting plot twist nthe farrelly brother and scriptwriter ed decter and john strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren any noticeable time where the film drag nthe only problem saw wa their use of couple of musician who provide segue between several key scene nthey appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot relevant information right toward the camera nit a device which wa amusing for about

learn this through strange home video like nightmare that he ha occasionally nthe big trial for steve is of course to fit in at school and make new friend nmarsden look like your stereotypical jock

informs steve that the local group of jock known a the blue ribboners are actually bunch of zombie assimilating new member into their group while sporadically killing innocent people nso it up to our group of mismatched protagonist to 1 solve the mystery and 2 do something about it nby the end of it all something ha happened and thing have been explained but the film still doesn make any sense ndisturbing behavior wa written by scott rosenberg ni ve seen his name around recently he wa one of the toucher upper on the armageddon script and imagine that for the most part he know what he doing when it come to screenwriting nhe did however have complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film and then decided to actually take the time to write it out nevil small town film are pretty common the last one phantom is also dismal failure but it take lot of skill to make the formula work nrosenberg script is complete mess lacking in even the most basic attempt at characterization nand it make no sense nor is their any purpose when thing are finally explained nthere is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jock but the film never explains exactly what is happening nthey get strapped to chair microchip is inserted into their eye and poof they become sex crazed superviolent machine like creature nthe doctor responsible for all this dr caldicott bruce greenwood must be pretty nut for thinking that this kind of behavior is step up from the way high school jock actually behave or perhaps this is the only realistic element in the film nmuch of the writing is simply bad and rosenberg ha no intuition when it come to the way high school kid act nin one terrible scene gavin explains to steve all of the high school clique while pointing them out in the cafeteria nup front should say that in four year of high school did not eat in the cafeteria even once nthat aside the various social group he point out are general uninteresting and poorly shown nfor instance he point to the nerd who are all wearing glass and playing with their laptop nit such an obvious cliche that can believe rosenberg even bothered nmost of the dialogue is forced no one say bite me nanymore and none of the scene have any degree of wit nthis picture is not inspired and most scene flop from one to the other with no sense of momentum or energy nthe blame for this can be placed on director david nutter who apparently like his film dry nhorror film should at least exploit violence but this one is shockingly timid nthere are few good scene though such a an interesting trip through an insane asylum this is however the most forced scene in the film for how our hero get there or why they bother are thing we never learn ni also liked the school janitor character played by william sadler nhe ha few line that are surprisingly thought provoking nthe acting is largely waste of talent nmarsden is a said bland thought not particularly bad nbruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted nstahl and holmes both show they have talent but the direction isn good enough to hone in on their skill stahl performance seems more like parody of high school pothead nnone of these character expand beyond their one dimension and frankly watching cardboard cut out of human being run down hallway while screaming just isn all that cool ndisturbing behavior is wreck of film and it started out wreck before shooting even began ni surprised there were producer who read this script and thought that it would make good film or that it would make lot of money at the box office nit not boring or even blatantly awful but it an uninspired lump of film nit sure start off nicely but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very

british big chill nand in some way it is nboth follow the rule a said and both feature lot of bitching big confessional and broken relationship nbut while the big chill wa at least to me tad too whiny and unsatisfying peter friend hit it mark making this film funny dramatic and poignant nthe friend of peter were all in the same theatre group back in 82 performig wildly outrageous british act for people far too stuck up to enjoy them the opening scene ha them all dancing in tux top and tutu nafter peter stephen fry wealthy father richard brier hardly on screen enough to register but oh well dy leaving giant mansion to him he ha to decide whether or not to keep it nnot sure what to do with it immeadiately he decides to throw giant reunion party inviting back all his old chum nof course all or most of his chum follow the tenth rule nandrew kenneth branagh also directing here is an actor who unhappily married to tv star carol co writer rita rudner nmaggie emma thompson is successfuly publisher of self help book but look like she need them more than her customer a she is lonely and unhappy nroger and mary hugh laurie and imelda staunton who were also married in sense and sensibility are married and are the most successful creator of jingle in the uk but have suffered tragedy a one of their newly born twin ha recently died nand sarah alphonsia emmanuel is a promiscuous a ever having new boyfriend a of two week named brian tony slattery who married and want divorce because of her giving her doubt na for peter thing seem okay nthe film feature lot of inner friend joke and even some old theatre anecdote which at least find lot of fun in a ve done lot of theatre myself nand there are big confession brawl between the friend and by the end almost everyone is unhappy even though some have resolved their problem long before the end which kinda dug nthe final twist would seem forced an anti climactic but for some reason felt the same way the rest of the friend did nmaybe it because the people in this film are so likable that just wanted to join their clique nthat really what make peter friend so lovable the way you just want to hang with group of friend who can be so dysfuntional sometimes but when someone in crisis can come together wonderfully for one another nit when you have giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that make you realize you have true friend and these people are true friend nnot to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80 decade grew up in unfortunately without taking u outside of the 90 nthere are some 80 classic and anti classic like tear for fear everybody want to rule the world but unfortunately no stupid fun 80 song think if ever did an 80 reunion film d put some crap go go song on or at least some good old come on eileen but this is the british 80 we re talking about noh well nbut anyway the direction is pretty good although nothing amazing nbranagh forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical but at least he very good with making le ambiguous film like this nthe writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman with lot of good one liner and even some really bad but good pun to mock the fact that andrew life in a peter while cutting some log asks him is he ha wood in a and andrew say no but we have hollywood punishment like that nthe actor a in most speaking movie are better than their material though with some stand out performance to the six friend a well a the outsider like slattery rudner and phyllida law a the old housekeeper of the peter mansion na little note should be made about hugh laurie performance a he look like he took some massive dos of prozac before doing this mean ve never seen him actually act this dramatically peter friend is really enjoyable film which make people like me pine for some sort of future reunion although don know what kind ll have like most people don look forward to my high school reunion nbecause of the way these friend are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such long period of seperation just look forward to the day when can have friend like that',\n",

an appealing actor and he handle his role adequately but we see little of him without various mask on nmore time needed to be spent on white character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings na special note should be made about martin sheen a the over the top obnoxious evil general wynn neasily the hammiest performance in the movie it hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much after all he played vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now nsheen excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him a mastermind villain and come a surprise

appreciate supernatural tale like the prophesy and those who crave grim dark thriller like silence of the lamb and seven nin fact there even little twin peak to be found here albeit with the lion share of the weirdness distilled out remember bob nthe biggest failing of fallen is that although it consistently interesting it not always a edgy and suspenseful a one might hope na serial killer elia koteas ha been on the loose in philadephia but detective john hobbes denzel washington the noblest man on the police force ha brought him to justice nnow during his last hour on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber the mass murderer cryptically tell hobbes what go around really go around nshortly thereafter he begin to sing time is on my side a he taken on his last walk nminutes later the state of pennsylvania ha carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead nbut for hobbes the nightmare is just beginning because reese wasn a normal psychopath he wa the host body for mythical dark angel named azazel nand with reese death azazel is free to hop from body to body murdering and wreaking havoc at will nonly hobbes and pretty female theology teacher embeth davidtz have an inkling of what they re up against nthe rest of the cop including hobbes partner jonesy john goodman lou james gandolfini newcomer to the department and lieutenant stanton donald

modern one nno skyscraper or other monolith of current architecture or technology are shown nthe most famous landmark to appear isn the liberty bell or independence hall it geno steak nshadows and night scene abound nthe day are cloudy and unpromising nthis is the kind of setting where it easy to believe that fallen angel walk among men nfallen plot is brimming with potential not all of which is realized nsomehow would have expected more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise nbut the level of terror like that of gore is kept in check nnevertheless there are several creepily effective scene a the spirit of azazel move from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalk nthe film also boast chase sequence of kind that can best be described a unusual nof the several dozen actor to play azazel the best is by far elia koteas exotica crash who despite only being on screen for about ten minute give fantastically charged performance njohn goodman also seems to be enjoying himself although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of burly sidekick nsadly however these two are the only one who excel neveryone else including denzel washington is boring nwashington flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film nit not that he bad per se but he not very interesting nthere no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character and that keep u distanced however slightly from hobbes na circumstance become progressively more dire for the cop and a his life or death chess game with azazel approach the point of checkmate expected to be more on the edge of my seat than wa nwashington subdued approach is part of the reason for this never felt sense of urgency nhowever at least washington wa believable which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz schindler list and donald sutherland nto be fair the flaw in their character aren all acting related neither stanton nor gretta milano are well written nthat said however there nothing inspired about either davidtz or sutherland work nboth appear to be sleepwalking their way through the part a if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing multi dimensional individual nnarratively fallen ha few glaring weakness nalthough the plot proceeds with convoluted game like structure it us denzel washington supplied voiceover to overexplain matter nat time this is actually helpful and it ha use beyond the obvious but there are occasion when ponderous line like like the night sometimes you come face to face with yourself become little hard to swallow nin addition fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland generic theology embraced by numerous movie and tv show like touched by an angel nhowever despite the negative m still recommending fallen on the strength of it complex plot and especially it ending which loved nthe final scene are startling audacious and unexpected nit not often that plot development take me by surprise the way this one did nat time when most movie fall apart in the last ten minute fallen

enterprise crew in the meantime experience the rejuvenating quality of the ba ku homeworld lt worf grows pimple data sings opera piece picard score with ba ku chick riker shave while sharing bubblebath with troi and the enterprise woman note their firmer breast ncomments star trek the next generation wa hugely successful sequel tv series to star trek science fiction series which developed devoted fan following in the 1970s neven though it still enjoyed high rating star trek the next generation ended production after seven year so that the cast could replace the original star trek cast in paramount film franchise centering on the voyage of the starship enterprise nstar trek insurrection is the ninth star trek movie and the third to focus on the star trek the next generation crew nstar trek insurrection qualifies a one of those movie star trek fan such a myself would rate somewhere between okay and good nafter star trek the final frontier nearly awful movie almost a bad a the repugnant star trek voyager tv series star trek fan could probably swallow anything paramount throw out in the trek film franchise ni don wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movie nmost people reading this probably haven followed star trek anyway so comparison would seem tedious at best nlet me thus make my comparison briefly so that it out of my system star trek insurrection is not a good a the previous installment star trek first contact star trek insurrection comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv the voyage home star trek ii the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie nokay let move to the movie itself nstar trek insurrection infuses basic science fiction premise humanity exploration and colonization of space with lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners nthis combination work well more often than it fails but when it doe fail the humor really seems cheesy nmuch of this film appeal to trek fan nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise crew naudiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot point and may even become confused at time nstar trek insurrection begin with scene of the tranquil life on the ba ku homeworld nforget the actor and special effect the beautiful setting of this movie with it snowy mountaintops and verdant valley steal the show nthis tranquility however is broken by data an android who reveals to the ba ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien ally the son nit seems that this world is veritable fountain of youth sustaining it inhabitant indefinantly in young healthy state nthe enterprise crew led by captain picard investigates data action and uncovers conspiracy between the son and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba ku and plunder the planet youth restoring property nsound pretty heavy nit is though this plot anything but unique and groundbreaking is undermined by the film constant barrage of humor nwhen going after data for instance picard sings an opera piece with him this is supposed to be cute and humorous nin much more funny sequence work grows large pimple on the side of his nose a result of his exposure to the ba ku homeworld pimple which his crewmates try a they might cannot avoid looking at nthe acting in star trek insurrection is for the most part pretty good nsince they ve been playing these character for year those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their role effortlessly enough nthe terrific actor patrick stewart play captain jean luc picard and delivers moral speech picard trademark with his usual aplomb nbrent spiner another fine actor play the android data well enough again and provides the best moment of comic relief in the film though the old android wishing to be human motif will tire some trek fan familiar with the routine from the tv series nthe supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good ndespite many other critic negative opinion murray abraham the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus play the major villain ru afro well enough nru afro reminds me somewhat of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune nlike the baron ru afro continuously ha his skin looked after it is stretched and stapled by servant nin one particularly memorable scene ru afro becomes very agitated and his facial skin split open and bleeds nru afro is no khan from star trek ii the best trek villain ever but he is much better than the forgettable dr soran from star trek generation okay promise no more comparison ndonna murphy must also be noted a ba ku woman anij who picard fall in love with nmurphy is not young woman with supermodel body she is mature woman with an attractive countenance nthis is the type of woman whom picard for those who know the character well would be enchanted with nin fact the chemistry between murphy and stewart work very well here na particular plot point involving anij ability to slow time down an ability which she share with picard becomes one of the most intriguing part of the movie nfor a good a the actor and setting were star trek insurrection special effect were surprisingly disappointing nthey proved adequate sometimes barely for 1990s mainstream science fiction film but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star war the phantom menace trailer which reportedly preceded many showing of insurrection nthe space battle involving the enterprise and sona ship in particular seemed trite and unsuspenseful and the final confrontation between picard and ru afro took place on completely unconvincing interior of satellite nthe new enterprise itself only seen in this film and it predecessor remains largely unexplored though it exterior doesn look quite right for reason cannot explain ndespite star trek insurrection frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effect enjoyed the film nit maintains roddenberry largely optimistic view of the future and reject the gritty violence of it predecessor particularly star trek first contact though don get me wrong the dark tone of trek film like first contact can work very successfully ni recommend insurrection a matinee film for saturday afternoon especially for fan of trek or science fiction in general nrated pg can see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience young or old',\n",

       " 'like the wonderful 1990 drama awakening starring robin williams and robert de niro at first sight directed by irwin winkler is inspired by true story documented by physicfirst sight directed by irwin winkler is inspired by true story documented by physician oliver sack nsince awakening wa so very good and made my top ten list the year it wa released at first sight is not quite a strong since it is not directed with a sure hand a penny marshall but is still an intelligent and vibrantly acted drama nthe film begin a amy mira sorvino stressed out new york architect decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country nat the hotel she is staying at she make massage appointment and after long soothing session which end with her cry a release of emotion she strike up conversation with the handsome masseur virgil val kilmer only to find out later that he is actually blind namy doesn really care if he ha handicap or not and begin to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love nonce she ha returned to new york amy begin to research on virgil certain type of retinal blindness which he ha had since three year of age and out of stroke of luck come into contact with doctor bruce davison who belief he can repair virgil sight even though there have only been thirty similar case in history nat first reluctant virgil finally travel with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery much to the hesitance of his overbearing but loving older sister kelly mcgillis nultimately the surgery is success but problem arise since virgil cannot relate to what he see since he ha never visually seen anything before only touched object nhe move into amy apartment and she is eager to stand by him but virgil maladjustment begin to put strain on their relationship non the basis of the overall story at first sight is indeed film that ha been done many time before and owes great deal to it predecessor awakening nwhat will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance nhowever what help at first sight rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy nusually romantic picture are of the shameless puppy dog sort the recent tom hank meg ryan starrer you ve got mail immediately pop to mind but with this film grew to care more about the character and their plight nthe film start off noticably well a amy travel up north and first meet virgil nthe massaging sequence were strangely erotic maybe even more so than the later actual love scene and a their romantic involvement quickly developed the film wa both entertaining and sweet and there wa clearly lot of chemistry between the two nthese joyous moment early on balanced out well with the later scene in which their relationship is seriously tested due to contrast in the life style that they have always known with virgil completely used to being blind and having comforting peaceful life in the country to amy eventful life in the big city nthe other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performance across the board nval kilmer usually cast in the macho type of role wa always believable a blind person and playing his character wa probably little more tricky than it appears nit wa up to kilmer to not come off a someone to pity but to sympathize with and he pulled it off nmira sorvino who made spectacular debuting splash in 1995 hilarious woody allen comedy mighty aphrodite for which she won well deserved oscar a kind hearted but ditzy hooker is standout here nalthough she ha made some mediocre film choice since then 1997 mimic 1998 the replacement killer she always ha managed to come out unscathed and it is with at first sight that she finally ha another juicy role to play nin truthful climactic scene set in amy apartment between she and virgil sorvino prof to be one of the most gifted young actress around today and ha flare for both comedic and dramatic piece nkelly mcgillis who could have easily come off a the bad one dimensional sister instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play a woman who may be overly protective but simply care for her brother nfinally nathan lane who is usually little too over the top is appropriately restrained a vision therapist nthe one misstep of at first sight is in it treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil nvery little is ever said or discussed concerning it and when the surgery occurs it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eye nperhaps the reason this aspect of the film wa not more in depth wa that the maker were afraid it would gross out audience but would personally take realism even if it is graphic any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder nin awakening the patient and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed nbecause of how strong the screenplay written by steve levitt is in the way it deal with the main relationship and because of the fabulous performance from kilmer and sorvino the film few problem can be swept over to the side nthe adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is no doubt in respect to the real life couple that the film wa inspired by who are still together after many year even though the setting of the film wa changed to new york nsince january is usually the time of year that is known a the dumping ground from bad movie at first sight come a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace',\n",

underwater neven the best fairy tale have bit of the macabre in it a the brother grimm have demonstrated nno my problem is with the story or lack thereof n_babe_ is sent out to save the hoggett farm

nwithout giving the ending away the farm is saved from left field quirk that had nothing to do with the pig nspeaking of pig or pig pig pig pig pig nthe word pig is so overused had they changed it to an expletive and had the pig be al pacino could have been watching _scarface_ nthis is screenwriting nfurther cannot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scene where accident happen to good people in fantastically elaborate setup nhad it been cartoon and the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd maybe my reaction would have been softened nbut to farmer hoggett nhis wife nan elderly

pregnant is his hard working wife none night while at party with their closest friend tom convinces maggie new age sister lisa illena douglas to try and hypnotize him nit unexpectedly work and before long tom is seeing thing he wouldn normally see including deceased teenage girl jenny morrison in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six month nseeking help from lisa she tell him that while he wa under hypnosis she told him that after he awoke his mind will remain clear and free like an opened door nshe didn expect it to work but it did and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find way to help this girl he see stir of echo isn a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination but in the thick atmospheric mood it conjures up it is terrifically eerie domestic horror drama and is not only effective on technical level but is impressive in it portrayal of struggling working class family nkevin bacon and especially kathryn erbe 1997 dream with the fish are top notch and exceedingly believable a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problem nafter tom is hypnotized and start seeing ghastly vision he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he ha seen lurking in his house and instead of maggie not being understanding she instead belief what tom say and aside from being little worried by what he is going through doe not try to stop his pursuit nbacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood star like tom cruise and julia robert and therefore are easier to relate to and always plausible a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their job just to make end meet nin masterfully done entrancing sequence tom is hypnotized by lisa but instead of watching him we instead see what he see starting from his view a he close his eye into darkness nlisa tell him to visualize being in an empty movie theater and so we a audience member are watching movie screen from inside theater which is also showing movie screen in theater ntelling him to move closer and closer to the screen a fuzzy word in black letter pop up on the screen we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is sleep nnever before have seen hypnotism scene a mesmerizing and brilliantly construed a this one ntruthfully this set piece and another in which tom wake up from nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he ha just dreamt are worth the full price of admission alone just to see them on the big screen nhaving load of fun with her small role a maggie sister lisa illeana douglas 1995 to die for her last great character is delight but rarely used to her full advantage in feature film nfunny and enjoyably offbeat douglas get to utter the best line in the film while talking to maggie about tom vision of the girl she remark wouldn be worried about him seeing another girl although the fact that she dead give one pause nalso of note are jenny morrison 1994 intersection who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character and liza weil remarkable in 1998 whatever a morrison grieving teenage sister debbie nif the resolution of stir of echo doe not live up to it obviously frightful full potential and it doesn what come before is both involving and appropriately gritty nthe music score by james newton howard and unsettling use of whisper and ghostly sound effect successfully compliment and foreshadow the off kilter frame of mind that tom is put into and director david koepp prof once again that he is director with knack for creating almost unbearably tense situation that revolve around realistically written character stir of echo isn a good a the sixth sense but why should it need to be nboth film are fully capable of standing on their own two foot and stir of echo really is spinetinglingly good horror film',\n",

will probably think would play out in our own living room were we faced with similar situation nroger michell use of visuals doesn sweep u off our foot but doe give u more than your typical movie of this type nfor example there are couple of instance in this film where large amount of time pas nwhereas some film are content to simply put in caption saying eight month later michell present u with more interesting cue such a william walk though his neighborhood while the season change around him nanother memorable shot occurs in park where the camera is lifted from ground level to couple of hundred foot in the air nwe re generally used to scene where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so but in this case the camera just keep going up and up until we have bird

ncomments may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here but have never seen an episode of the fox tv series party of five ni am only vaguely aware of the show premise and my knowledge of it come from brief commercial half paid attention to while watching the tube party of five do know however seems to be the starting ground for actress in the teen horror genre nneve campbell scream queen of the 90 and star of scream scream 2 and the craft is regular of the show nso too is jennifer love hewitt nlo and behold following in the footstep of campbell hewitt now ha horror franchise of her own the know what you did last summer line nthough the original film released last year wa watchable enough this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater glowing red exit sign longingly throughout njennifer love hewitt is very good looking young leading lady however unlike neve campbell hewitt struggle with acting nshe just isn convincing in this film and she wasn in the original either nthis put many young male including myself in paradoxical quandary she very attractive but the annoying spoiled valley girl type character she try to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruin many of the scene which emphasize exploitatively her figure nadd to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy another rising teen tv star and you get one frustrated male audience ni ve spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for reason ni still know what you did last summer though cashing in on the success of the original ultimately serf a vehicle for these two young actress nnothing else here is original or interesting nthis movie in fact make other recent so so horror film like urban legend and john carpenter vampire seem like stunning work of high art ni still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliche an isolated location storm parentless teenager false alarm nightmare lot of blue lighted darkness scene garbed slasher who walk around in the background without the character seeing him knife and other sharp instrument lying around everywhere etc you get the picture nthe entire audience know all the secondary character introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer hook nthey may a well have huge target painted on them nlike scream and it numerous knockoff these secondary character are supposed to serve a comic relief nunfortunately still know character aren all that funny nin particular one character chain weed smoking guy is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesn die soon enough nthe death scene by the way are relatively violent for theatrically released horror film nseveral of them are uncomfortable to watch and they reminded me of the sickening gore scene in hellraiser bloodline truly sadistic movie nthis too did not help the supposed humor still know wa shooting for nand what is the deal with the slasher himself ni know that the slasher film is not particularly intelligent genre but ben willis ha got to go down a one of the most silly slasher in mainstream horror ncome on the guy look like the gorton fisherman and his gruff voice make him sound like disney pirate nthough his lightning lit appearance ellicited much needed laughter in the theater his appearance border on the absurd in the horror film and that really saying something nso all that left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy nboth prance about in tightfitting revealing outfit or in various state of undress yet neither of them ever actually do nude scene nhewitt however doe do post shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite n titillating nthis scene alone made this one star turkey earn two star under my rating system notherwise hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerve nearly in the film for instance brandy win the trip to the bahamas nshe and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever ni needed extra strength tylenol after that part noh and the film conclusion talk about repetitive npeople who saw know what you did last summer will predict still know ending at least 5 minute before it happens nboring ni saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater nadmission is only one dollar on wednesday and we often go see bad movie on these day just to ridicule them nit usually fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience who don seem to mind participating in mass mystery science theater 3000 type viewing ni still know what you did last summer however produced several lengthy uncomfortable silence from the audience underscoring how bad it really is nif it weren for the main actress revealing wardrobe d have had very very hard time sitting through this lame sequel ni can imagine trying to watch it on video horror film seem 10 time better in theater because they rely heavily on audience participation and wouldn recommend it to people unless they re horror film fanatic or huge fan of hewitt and brandy ni read on website somewhere that another sequel is already in the work nwhat depressing thought nhewitt apparently need to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act nrated this film contains lot of violence several gory

nthey are likely to be remembered for n nwell quite while ni like this film too nyes it a disaster slash action movie ntrue it budget is lot more money than ll ever see in my lifetime nand there not doubt in my mind that the only reason it wa conceived wa to make lot of money nin fact bet the producer of armageddon would have worked towards lousy film had they thought it would ve been more profitable ni certainly don care what their intention were because michael bay the rock is such skilled director that doubt he ever make film that is difficult to sit through nof course skillful direction doesn complete the package but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together nthe story is well thought out and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequence that never feel out of place the acting is terrific the script is sharp and get this there are character nyes you read that right narmageddon actually ha character you can care about nif you don like this film then you have problem with the genre itself armageddon is a good a film like this can be nif you ve seen deep impact then you know the basic framework for the story nit turn out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen day from the start of the film nso it up to the s government to stop it why the s is always exclusively saddled with these problem is never fully investigated ntheir plan to send group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid drill down several hundred foot and detonate nuclear warhead within nthe head driller is harry stamper bruce willis nhis group of men is colorful bunch including j ben affleck chick will patton and rockhound steve buscemi nthere also an interesting triangle formed between j harry and grace liv tyler who is harry daughter na nand grace are of course romantically intertwined and dad isn too happy with the situation nit absurd to wish for complicated story in an event movie or special effect movie or whatever it is you like to call armageddon nit not about story it about viscera and action and thrill minute and all that stuff nit incidental really that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosion to give two second thought to what actually happens nbut bay is the one to congratulate in this case for he ha made film so entertaining and so visually sharp that doubt any director could have done it better ni think most of the budget went to camera alone because bay film every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angle ntake the spectacular opening scene for instance in which meteor shower obliterates new york na meteor fly out of the sky and crash into building which sends fireball erupting into the air and car spinning like top upon other car nthe action itself might take five second in real life but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different way ni like his quick edit style because it abrasive and exhausting to watch nit also very loud and obnoxiously noisy at time nbut it fun to be obnoxious sometimes nthe special effect in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame ndeep impact visually ha absolutely nothing on armageddon and to offer comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable nspecial effect are very important in film like this if they re not good then the image is not convincing and the film doesn work neverything here look bright and explosive from the little meteor bursting through skyscraper all the way to the shot of the earth through the jutting rock on the ominously approaching asteroid nthe effect that don look totally real are still pleasure to behold and credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice looking that it actually qualifies a art nof course all of this would add up to little more than an above average light show if didn get the feeling that bay care a much about his character a he doe about his action nthe film is two and half hour long and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action nmuch of the film is dedicated to developing the various character subplots ni won suggest that these are complex character but their problem are real and the emotion aren put forth in sentimental and overbearing way nin fact there are three or four scene here that had me pretty choked up and that a lot more than can say about deep impact which wa banking on the feel good part of it story nbruce willis is terrific and m glad to see him bigger than life again recent turn in film like mercury rising have been very disappointing ntyler and affleck are great together and make convincing couple all of the scene between them work on comfortable level npatton who is magnificent actor thankfully is not wasted here and the minor subplot revolving around his ex wife and son is very moving nthe comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare who play crazy russian astronaut is nifty and keep the film lively and funny ni wasn challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon and don mind too much nbut the film doesn insult my intelligence it pitched perfectly to entertain which is what all it really want to do nit not mindless and escapist but well crafted cinema nit might have been created for the wrong reason but men

from other film and in most case better film nif this is the sort of thing you don mind you might like the film nof course there are other reason not to like mission to mar the main one being script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who haven used their brain in some time and who don intend to start during the film running time mission to mar manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time nthe plot cribbed greatly from 2001 concern team sent to mar the first manned trip ever made to the red planet nluke graham don cheadle lead the team jointly formed of american and russian nthe team encounter mysterious monolith that emits strange pulse this being nothing like the pulse emitting monolith in 2001 that one wa on the moon but when they try to study it giant sand tornado come out of the top and swallow them all except luke who survives long enough to send garbled message back to the rotating space station which look strangely like the

and extra crew member phil ohlmyer jerry connell along for the ride nafter some zero gravity dancing they run into problem when one of their engine is blown forcing them to attempt desperate landing aboard supply vessel nnow stranded on mar with minimal supply the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home nafter all that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth mission to mar is one of those film that make critic wonder where to start when talking about all the thing that are wrong with it so let start with one of the thing that doe work director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in few scene during the middle of the film nthat it neverything else fails nthe failure isn de palma fault he working from an atrocious script nonly during the sequence aboard the ship looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in 2001 where the rescue team air begin running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up doe mission to mar come to life na scene where they attempt to save comrade floating away into space also provides some tension until you realize that the entire danger more danger attempted rescue sequence ha absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film it just contrived way to generate thrilling scene ntake it out and the plot isn affected in any way nthe sequence also suffers from few plot hole a doe the rest of the film why is the ship computer which sound strangely like hal from uh 2001 able to detect hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine nwhy did tim robbins character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside nshouldn the astronaut be better trained to deal with hull breach nwhy are the character such idiot nbecause the script make little attempt to properly develop them nall the conflict is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene which rip off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing long opening tracking shot during which the character repeatedly tell each other about thing all of them should already know jim it too bad

find out these thing in le grating matter like maybe in flashback nthe whole film is like that nthe filmmaker are not content to merely show u something and assume we know what going on they must tell u exactly what we re looking at every time nsample dialogue from the film shot of mar astronaut look there mar astronaut you sure that mar nastronaut yeah that mar all right nastronaut hey are you guy looking at mar nthat exchange isn actually in mission to mar but wouldn be surprised if it were nfor all their cribbing from kubrick spielberg james cameron and even ron howard the maker of this film haven learned to do something all those director did very well show and don tell nde palma used to know how but seems to have forgotten nthis is mentally challenged filmmaking they assume the audience won get what going on so they explain everything five time over nfourth grader may appreciate this but more learned viewer will have their intelligence insulted nthe principal actor sleepwalk their way through mission to mar never managing to do away with an apparent m just here to get paycheck attitude ncheadle stumble over his awkward line narmin mueller stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo nrobbins put his game face on and phone in his standard decent guy performance nand sinise ham it up with wistful facial expression while watching tape of his dead wife played by kim delaney who only ha one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in heavy handed monologue about the meaning of life and especially during the stolen from no le than three movie lollipop to whoever name them conclusion which combine endless obvious explanation and sub par cgi effect with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewer who had been enjoying the show up until then nand of course these alien from mar who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the alien in 2001 who facilitated the evolution of life on earth those alien were from an unknown world nit could be said that fan of brainless action film might enjoy mission to mar but such comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow going nleisurely pacing might have helped film with little more substance to it but all of the substance of mission to mar ha been stolen from other film and those other film dealt with their idea in much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging character nsupposedly we re intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one totally different from the one character decides not to return ending of armageddon but suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning nme alternated between the two nthere is only one good thing

swearing vengeance against all vampire blade hunt them all nhis latest challenge is his biggest though he nmust stop the vampire deacon frost played by stephen dorff from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampire nadmitedly comic book are one of the least appreciated medium often viewed a juvenile by most standard even seen a illiterate by some njudging by series of poorly recieved financial and critical comic book based film such a batman and robin steel barb wire the crow city of angel and the list go on one would come to the conclusion that comic book are the worst medium to translate into film nto some degree agree with this sentiment nhaving read comic book since the age of nine m 21 right now can count the number of good comic book based movie not including japanese manga one hand 1 the crow 1994 2 batman 1989 3 superman 4 the mask and now 5 blade men in black is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book nwhy is this nfor the most part it is because the filmmaker understand nthe comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match nthe crow and batman comic call for dark gothic atmosphere which the director provided nthe mask feature wacky superhero with off the wall antic which the casting and cg effect reflect nsuperman ni not over the top with colour and flash and the film reflects this nblade us common notion of vampire and incorporates them into the film creating an appropriate atmosphere nthis is in stark contrast to joel schumacher contrived vision in batman and robin reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960 television show nbatman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact comic have grown up and so ha the audience m working on scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when m ready nwhich brings me back to blade nalthough he may be familiar character to some due to his appearance in the spider man animated show on fox one will find no single trace of the warm and fuzzy vampire hunter a depicted in the cartoon nthe film depicts vicious vampire killer that nu every single mean at his disposal to reach his end nthe end result are not pretty by any mean nthe story element work very well for comic book story nscreenwriter david goyer who also wrote the crow incorporates interesting element of vampire lore using science to explain many of the idea often dismissed in vampire film nthis is presented through karen hematologist portrayed by bushe wright nthis lead to inventive use of standard medical treatment to kill vampire nadd this nto the neat little gadget that blade us including titanium sword complete with an anti theft device and one ha an interesting premise nhowever the film work best a an action film nactor wesley snipe ha nan extensive background in martial art most of which come from capoeira brazillian form incorporating flashy kick choreographing every single move nproving that quick flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequence see batman and robin for ngood example of that wesley snipe dazzle the audience with some incredible fight scene nregardless this film is far from perfect nthe film suffers from at least one major plot hole regarding the summoning of the blood god nthe ritual requires that number of pure blood vampire are standing on nmarked square yet one of them is viciously murdered allowing the ritual to pas and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square nobvious continuity error also surface especially during scene where deacon frost take drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame there is no trace of smoke either nmuch of the special effect are not that spectacular either nwhile vampire disintegration scene are intriguing to watch other cgi computer generated imagery effect are almost slapped together which is surprising when given the amount of time the film wa given to be released the film release date wa pushed back multiple time nscenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake knocking the believability factor down few notch but then m really hard to impress nthe film r rating come from gory violence but the lack of nrealism made me wonder why it got such rating for realistic violence nwatch saving private ryan nthe overuse of cgi in film ha made me yearn for the day of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin both pioneer in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi nstill scene involving non cgi special effect do surface and look much more impressive such a one particularly gruesome scene where vampire try to use blade sword without deactivating the anti theft device nwesley snipe is the saving grace behind what would have otherwise been muddled mess nwhile not talking much he is grand physical presence leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust na decent by comic book film standard storyline also

unsatisfied and generally kinda weirded out nbut then again not every film supposed to leave you entertained crash is structured to play like porn flick but with significantly more plot and dialogue nwhile we see several extremely taboo scene of weirdo sex we also have skimpy little plot going on mostly towards the beginning and maybe just hair of characterization nnot to mention the acting is generally pretty good and we don really see lot of the actor completely exposed nbut what make it supremely different from porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience nthis film doe not pose the erotic hypnotism of henry and june or the just plain horniness of say deep throat not that ve seen it nif one wa to be made completely hot by this film it would probably mean they were also into the whole auto eroticism thing nthe film leaf you cold erotically and maybe in many other way but what it doe is present group of people who live on the edge nthe film open up on woman catherine deborah kara ungar of the game pressing her bare breast up against car in public air hangar nsuddenly man enters the frame and begin to take her from behind the film doesnt show all this though even if it is nc 17 nthe next scene ha film director james james spader having sex with camera woman alice poon in an office on the highly populated set of his movie nthe next scene ha the two coming together revealing to u that they re husband and wife and them sharing in one another escapade nwhile the two are arguably freaky people we at least know they love to live on the edge nsoon afterwards james is driving down the road at night reclessly of course he reading something when he drift into the other lane and then hit another car face on njames is not killed but the passenger in the other car fly into his seat obviously dying leaving the driver helen remington holly hunter in porn also alive nthe two go through therapy together and when getting out they run into eachother again nwhen james give her ride home they almost get into another accident and immeadiately afterwards they go to an unbusy parking lot and have little quickie a they were aroused by the accident nyou wouldn think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish but they run into freaky guy named vaughan elia kosteas and his crutch carrying girlfriend gabrielle rosanna arquette who are also into it nvaughan is into living on the edge a they are but he take it to another level he love to recreate famous car crash nin one scene he and friend colin seagrave peter macneill recreate james dean car crash without any padding or safety belt and suffer some concussion but nevertheless get rush and the attention of the police nsoon these five are all having sex with one another be it straight gay or lesbian sex nwhile this is admittingly all bit comical the film is almost like black comedy the film doe do pretty awesome portrayal of people who main fetish is living on the edge ni sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accident but personally don see connection between car crash and sex nthe main connection cronenberg show u that both give definite rush nhis car crash scene are quick and exciting mini masterpiece we re at first not sure if they ll take place but everytime it look like it may occur we gasp nthen when it happens we hold our breath nthe same thing happens with sex although not in the same fashion nthese people are merely taking it to another level nthe only problem with the film is that it a tad redundant na normal porn last from an hour to an hour and half nthis go on for about 100 minute and it just seems little too long nthe sex and car crash are far between one another and the time between them are tad on the boring side nthere no characterization although it could definitely be argued that hey it a porn and we re not here to sympathize nbut still they coulda cut it down bit nbut the film is saved with it presentation a well a some other element nthe atmosphere is very dark and forboding creating kind of cool weird feeling nand there are several scene are just amazing none scene ha catherine and james having sex while she softly asks him question about being with man which sound almost erotic the way she say it na sequence involving one character death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film need nand the final shot is shot perfectly creating an image of car crash and couple having sex in front of it despite the fact that she wounded nthe acting is also pretty good especially for what is almost porn ousting linda lovelace a best actress in porn nwhile james spader is pretty boring he usually pretty intense deborah kara ungar is amazing nshe speaks all her word in almost zombie like hush and when she having sex she ha blank look on her face not showing the viewer whether she enjoying it or not nin one scene she actually look dead while someone is having sex with her nholly hunter who get extra credit just for appearing in something like this is pretty good and so is rosanna arquette who add kinda cool kinkiness to her role nbut the film is stolen by elia kosteas who play his character so intensely that he almost upstage everyone nhe often speaks a he is out of breath showing definite affinity for his way of life nhe ha great deal of energy in several scene especially one scene where he taking photograph of picture and later scene where he getting freaky tatoo nhe and spader share sexual chemistry in several scene foreshadowing later scene nkosteas is little known actor his biggest role wa casey jones in teenage mutant ninja turtle but here he show deniro like presence hinting that he capable of bigger role nwhile hardly enjoyed crash it still pretty intriguing portrayal of group of people who if the exist are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world nthese people are able to share rush between two completely different entity and the film which doesn exactly pain them in negative light is sucessful in bringing them to light even if it leaf the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out ndespite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc 17 rating there also an rated version but wouldn even go near that thing anyone looking for quick turn on should just rent regular porno',\n",
       " 'when first saw the preview for cruel intention turned to my friend and said dangerous liaison for kid nit wa clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense owing everything it is to stephen frears 1988 masterpiece nimagine my surprise to see that writer director roger kumble ha given credit to his source material choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel le liaison dangereuses in the opening credit nand wa impressed nin fact wa much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film which is an appalling excuse for movie nit kiddie porn hackwork complete with earthy sex talk and fully clothed hand job ni suppose this kind of movie wa inevitable with all the teen high school angst movie coming out there wa certainly room for pretentious and laughable movie about bunch of teenager who think they re smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined ncruel intention is mess in every possible way and it fails primarily in the way expected it to hated all the character and hate everything they do ni also hate ryan phillippe so perhaps my opinion is not a objective a it could be nphillippe play check out this name sebastian valmont nwow nisn that memorable name ni could just say it over and over again nsebastian valmont nit kind of roll off the tongue in the spirit of phrase like sanguine vapor and velvet sandwich nsebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth there is no woman he can have no material object out of his reach nhe ha all the money all the sex all at his fingertip nand luckily his parent never enter into his life no in the world of cruel intention adult don really exist nthe one who do are irritating nsebastian valmont life with his stepsister kathryn merteuil sarah michelle gellar the bitch queen of the universe and also the woman every man want nsince these two rich kid are so bored they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaison nkathryn want sebastian valmont to de virginize cecile caldwell selma blair naive dork chick who ha somehow wronged kathryn nbut it too easy for sebastian valmont he want to nail annette hargrove reese witherspoon the paradigm of chastity and beauty nso sebastian valmont and kathryn make deal which is too explicit to state here nbut dear god sebastian valmont actually begin to fall for poor annette hargrove ndangerous liaison is great movie because the character are all believable and because of it masterful acting ncruel intention is bad for many reason but it lack both believable character and masterful acting nkathryn merteuil is simply hateful witch girl so loathsome that would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her nshe is supposed to be mean but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaison ngellar while aesthetically pleasing is one dimensional and utterly repulsive nwitherspoon ha truly beautiful face but her character isn the moral staple she supposed to be sure she won have sex until she in love is this really moral issue but she doe some thing in the last few scene that are more than little reprehensible nbut can forget mr phillippe who continues to exceed my expectation with his impenetrable invulnerable blandness ni have to give him credit and say that he did in fact manage to change his facial expression about three time during the course of cruel intention nand there one point in the film in which he shout thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone ntrue he is bad but it doesn help that he ha no character to work with nkumble ha drained all the interesting aspect from this character leaving u with sex crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he fall in love with moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch nthe film fails in every other way too nfirst of all nobody talk like this neven the intellectual know don bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering nfor while the movie look like it might play itself for laugh but it end up taking itself so seriously that there no way we can join it ncruel intention also manages to come off a soft porn in more than one scene nearlier mentioned fully clothed hand job this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie nso if we hate them then what the point of an extended sex scene ntitillation of course nit can even work under the pretense of meaningful love scene because we hate the character nit interesting to note some of the parallel between cruel intention and dangerous liaison nkumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film many of the scene have similar tone and there are moment in frears film that kumble imitates almost completely such a the last scene in which spoiler warning the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peer nbut kid don act like this nnobody act like this nin his translation roger kumble

right complete with spill thrill and especially chill nmuch ha been made of the humongous cost of the production and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again nthe money wa obviously well spent nthe costume look great the set look great the cgi graphic look great ni especially liked the expensive little touch like spending ton of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor a the ship sink nbut writer director producer james cameron real challenge in writing directing producing titanic wasn just costuming and set design and special effect ncameron major headache wa keeping the audience interested in tale where everybody know the ending going in nhe succeeds masterfully ncameron doe two thing that work incredibly well nfirst he show u modern day salvage operation on titanic that just titanic not the titanic mind you nthe first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in it present state corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic from the window of minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton ntelevision coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigue 101 year old rose calvert gloria stuart who survived the wreck in 1912 nstuart doe phenomenal job in brief role narrating the story of her experience to stunned paxton and his roughneck crew nsecondly cameron keep the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character and the romantic triangle between rose winslet her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley billy zane and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon dicaprio nthe way that big budget disaster movie usually go wrong is to have an all star cast so we see the impact of the disaster on wide group of people ncameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack while paying scant heed to the celebrity on board nthe supporting cast is professional but mostly anonymous other than kathy bates a the unsinkable molly brown there no moment when you stop and say oh yeah know him what he been in although would like to have seen colm meaney in white star uniform or even a the ill fated engineer nthe love story itself is rather conventional ni think some reviewer found it weak and that may be fair criticism nthe performance are the key here nzane ha the meatiest part in the movie and he play the arrogant condescending steel millionaire to the hilt nhe smooth he look great in tuxedo and he a convincing enough jerk that the winslet dicaprio relationship look plausible nat the moment when he see little girl too frightened to get aboard lifeboat you can hear the wheel in his mind turning saying not can save this little girl nbut can she help me get on lifeboat ndicaprio is revelation ni hadn seen him before in anything and didn know what the heck to expect really honestly expected bad irish accent but cameron evidently decided that wa bad idea so dicaprio play poor american artist who win ticket in poker game ndicaprio exhibit an infectious joy at being alive and being on the titanic that it hard not to like him nfrom the moment that the ship leaf port until it hit the iceberg dicaprio ha to carry the movie and keep our interest and he never falter nwinslet character grows up lot during the movie and so doe her performance nat first she not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop dead gorgeous nwe know from the narration that she monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane but there isn any expression of these feeling until she encounter dicaprio nwinslet and dicaprio develop chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hit the iceberg nit at that moment where winslet character really come alive nfaced with real danger she drop her spoiled rich girl mannerism and doe splendid job na rose and jack race around the doomed ship looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal fiery temper winslet turn in superb acting performance mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror nof course the most interesting character is the ship itself ncameron ha clearly fallen in love with titanic and show her in every mood a deserted wreck down in the boiler room up on the bridge down in the hold at the captain table down in steerage and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead ncameron greatest gift is that he allows u to fall in love with titanic a well',\n",
       " 'there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason good will hunting is about one of those people nthe will hunting of the horrible title let face it this film would be bitch to title played by co writer matt damon is mathematical genius nhe can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it take to brew cup of irish cream cappuccino nand he work at mit a the janitor none day the professor of one of the most challenging course proffessor lambeau breaking the wave stellan skarsg rd put big problem on the board for his student to attempt to complete nthe next day it already done on the board but no one in his class claim to have done it nso lambeau put another problem on the board this time one that took he and his colleague over two year to prove nand duh it done again nof course they catch the guy who did it red handed will nbefore lambeau can find will again he ran away when he caught him will ha gotten into fight with bunch of punk on basketball court and struck police officer so lambeau get him out on probation with two agreement he work with him on math and he get some therapy nafter going through some therapist whom he psyche out in one way or another for hypnotist he fake being under his spell then launch into an impromptu performance of the 70 classic afternoon delight nfinally lambeau old college roomate sean mcguire robin williams psych professor agrees to treat him and the two begin rocky relationship a sean try to get will to open up nturns out will had rough childhood being abandoned and placed in foster home and what not nit also turn out that will doe not want to do simple mathematics all his life he want challenge nand that is to hang out with his bud including the other co writer ben affleck and do honorable job like construction ni it right to make this genius follow in the footstep of einstein and kasinsky nshould this guy be forced to do something he doesn want to do nthis appears to be one of the million question in this film which is jam packed with greatness but doe not have the totally brilliant whole it should ni not saying good will hunting is bad film at all nit a very enjoyable film with ton of great moment and lot of great thing about it nthe acting is amazing with two oscar nomination worthy performance from damon and williams who have amazing chemistry together nwe also get some great support from stellan skarsg rd great name ben affleck and from minnie driver who play will love interest skylar nthere are ton of individual moment that adored ni loved all the comedy in the film especially scene where damon prof schmuck out of college student who is quoting historian to impress some chick his various attempt at therapy and of course my favorite scene in the entire film the one where he delivers long exstensive rant to some nsa agent about the downside of working for them ni liked the relationship between some of the people like will and skylar will and sean sean and lambeau and will and his friend nthere are scene between them which are just amazing to watch nand there are even moment in the film which are so honest in their portrayal that felt rightfully uncomfortable nlike the break up scene between will and skylar will and sean first meeting bar scene between sean and lambeau and scene where sean tell in detail how he doesn regret meeting his first wife who would later suffer slow painful death and leave him lonely and slightly bitter nhowever the main flaw of the film is there too much of everything and not enough of it either nthe film try for deeper relation between the character but they re sometimes either overwritten or underwritten ntake for example the relationship between sean and will the film get an interesting father son a well a doctor patient relationship going with out any problem but when it try to show them a equal it fall on it face nwe hear how they went to the same town and there are even scene where the film show how hypocritical both of them are at time nbut this never take off like the other part of their relationship do nalso will relationship with his best friend chuckie affleck ha nice climax but not enough rising action nwe see them joking around but when chuckie arrives at decision between the two of them it seems more like superficial reasoning than more selected one ntheir relationship never go beyond just best friend and his decision just seems to be generalization of any two best friend instead of something more human nmaybe it wa just me nand it also go for parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau but that again is underwritten nand of course a in most film like this the girl boy relationship is pretty underwritten nwe never understand what they see in each other so when skylar confesses that she love him it seems more like it there for plot detail that anything else nminnie driver is interesting though and breathes life into her character nthe writing is bit at fault here but what make all this worthwhile is the little moment in the film where it acheives true awesomeness nsure it feel overstuffed but it extremely enjoyable nthe dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh and seems extremely human ni think that they should get nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue which is amazing nwhile this is probably director gu van sant most conservative film you hardly know it the same director of to die for the only van sant film ve seen really it still pretty remarkable film albeit tad overrated what this best picture deal nand if film put smile on my face despite posessing lot of flaw have no problem with reccomending it to anyone',\n",

thing saving it from 0 10 rating is that being able to rent movie like this is slightly le embarassing than renting porno nso it doe indeed have some plus nin fairness elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff nand her ability to whine and irritate u even while nude wa appropriate in her role a selfish temptress nomi malone nthis character is not smart not interesting and

drawn caricature that are never allowed any depth or development nerica is the nature loving wiccan ntristen is the weak and sympathetic woman nsteven is the overbearing asshole nkim is the antisocial goth girl nold tired cliche were used to illustrate these caricature nhow do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic nbecause she pregnant nhow do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl nbecause she wear lot of eye makeup nhow do we know the local sheriff is bad guy nbecause he ha jagged teeth and talk like he straight out of deliverance nthis is weak storytelling at it worst nrather than taking the time to flesh out the character and make them truly sympathetic the writer chose to give each one few stereotypical characteristic in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action nit didn work non top of being poorly developed most of the character were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid honey you just had miscarriage out in the wood and got medical attention at hospital that look like it belongs in bad slasher movie nlet get on plane home no ni am having these bizarre nightmare and seeing strange vision and want to find out what going on ok nfrankly by the end of the movie wa rooting for the witch ni also felt that there wa simply too much blood gore in this film nthe first movie worked by never showing u the horror nthe witch wa palpable presence in that movie but we never saw it we never saw anything in fact nthe horror wa all off screen and thus our imagination worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be nthis is the hallmark of truly creepy and disturbing horror movie nblair witch 2 dispensed with such nicety and went straight for the gross out nthis wa evident from the opening scene of the mad doctor forcing white goo down jeffrey throat and continued throughout the film a the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be ritual massacre of some sort nknives plunge into flesh bloody finger trail off into the darkness and none of it is explained until the very end when it wa too late for me to care nthis movie didn stop with showing u the gore either it went for broke and showed u everything nby the end of the movie there are no question remaining about the missing five hour nit is all explained in fact it is all shown on screen in loving detail ni confess to being someone who prefers horror movie in which you never see the monster or see only brief glimpse mere suggestion of what the monster is it is not because find the monster so terrifying but because find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying ni have seen interview with the director in which he suggested that there is no monster that all of the evil wa perpetrated only by the human mind ni found this to be miserably poor explanation if it wa in fact the director intent then he need to have some word with the writer because it wa not made clear at all i know lot of people who like to go to party and get drunk and stoned out of their mind none of them ha ever gone on murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucination with group of other people for the next week or so nand if there wa no witch then what about the vanishing tree nthe snowfall of manuscript paper nhm nblair witch 2 book of shadow wa horrible movie nfrom the poorly written character to the implausible story to the plot inconsistency to the gross out shot it wa bad effort through and through',\n",
       " 'andrew lloyd webber musical preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice present musical which is totally unlike any musical before it time nwebber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musical a oklahoma or the slapstickness of show like funny thing happened on the way to the forum nthey instead tackle hot issue from our past and view them differently and pack them together with redundant catchy music a well a thoughtful lyric nlike jesus christ superstar which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last day from fame perspective in the cool tune superstar dead juda come back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn spread his message wider evita take an inventive stance on it topic this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator juan per eva who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention much like the woman playing her madonna although think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent among other thing evita deal with the rise and fall of eva per a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan jonathan pryce then died at the young age of 33 creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di the two do share bit in common although it wasn like di slept to the top nwebber and rice sure chose bizarre topic for their musical but they always have point for doing it nhere they wish to expose her for what she is but still show that despite all of her many drawback her lying and covering up for her fascist husband but show that she wa still good woman with fairly good intention and her death wa very sad nit also musical with almost no word not unsung nthe film play like rock opera much like their jesus christ superstar with many giant musical sequence just like the old musical even if they do posse very intelligent lyric which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience but also very entertaining one nafter all this is musical and webber musical never undermine this nthey are balance of energy and intellectual depth walking on fine line between the both and never stumbling on either side nthis is why the beginning of evita is kind of let down nokay it is let down ni not saying the opening moment are bad because they re pretty good nbut what come after is lifeless un entertaining and totally unrewarding sequence where she con singer jimmy nail into taking eva to buenos aire after one night stand nin the musical it a fun energetic sequence culiminating in the show stopper buenos aire which is also lifeless nthen punch is pulled a we see eva being screwed over by the singer instead of her leaving him where she end up singing the sad tune another suitcase in another hall which wa meant for later character screwed over by eva nthe portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft seeming like parker and oliver stone who adapted it for the screen are afraid to present her for what she is even while it being narrated by hater of eva the omnipotent antonio banderas who present her in negative light nfor while it look like alan parker can pull it off nhowever the film pull itself together in flash and after that song is over and the giddily nihilistic song goodbye and thank you where we see eva go through long line of lover who help her ascend is magnificent darkly comical and just gleeful nfrom this point on the film is hypnotic satisfying and satirical nno more punch are thrown and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact nwe see eva woo and marry juan get him out of jail rise to stardom falter bit come back and then gradually die of cancer think it wa because of cancer nmore importantly many of the theme from the musical carry on with this a well a some filling in the gap reconnassaince work njuan who is pretty underwritten in the musical is given some extra scene and exposed a what he wa for eva an accessory na muted scene where he try to visit her respective room but is shunned allows u to learn more about juan and understand his sadness more than we did before from the goodbye and thank you number on the film show eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty thing which wooed nation and saved government even while it left the nation people downtrodden nbut despite this the nation still loved eva and when she slipped into death the world mourned her because she wa star nthat when our narrator ch come out to show that she wasn the great woman she really wa and expose her fame ndescribing this character is difficult mainly because he ha no real realistic background he said to be based on the revolutionary ch guevera but the two probably could have never met like they do in the film but he serf a perspective on eva but even his perspective can help u from feeling bad when eva dy pathetic death nalan parker no stranger to bizarre musical he done fame the committments bugsy malone and pink floyd the wall the latter which is absolutely brilliant nail the film exposing everything for what it is nwe cry for evita at the end because we feel we should by the way it is presented nhis direction is manipulative for reason to show the mourning for what it is nand there is energy throughout with lot of bright color and scene which are cinematically entertaning a well a enriching and deep such a the balcony scene where she sings don cry for me argentina and her death sequence which is poignant becuase of how sad it is nmadonna golden globe winning performance is much like the movie start kinda downhill then go up quickly remaning there for the rest of the film nat the beginning she look like she too busy concentrating on her singing to act but she eventually get it right though never really getting the presence of say patti lupone who did the role in it american premiere back in the late 70 nher death though is brilliant nher singing could be better though ni know she took lesson to improve her range and all but it still sound like she trying to hard nshe sound way too soft in several place where she should be comanding like patti nlupone heard her sing on an old evita cd and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her nbut it generally very good although not up to the brilliance the role really requires nantonio banderas who is almost like guilty pleasure these day m one of the few people who think he rock is extremely comanding in his performance presenting lovable narrator nhis singing is very good though nothing compared to the original mandy patinkin nhe doe have pretty good singing voice and great range nand jonathan pryce is pretty awesome although very brief at time in his role a juan seeming to put on poker face for his melancholy facade nalthough it get off to rocky start rocky polite for what it really is it soon pick up and becomes wonderully poignant musical nlike the other musical released in 96 woody allen everyone say love you it a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead but it can come back every now and then for brief performance',\n",

all this can even comment on george clooney a batman hardly saw the guy nand when did he had horrible dialogue to say ni think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer wa too robotic and fake a batman in the last episode ngeorge is in between them nhe not quintessential he not horrible he good nbut m sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they ll be

it nthat why the next two big budget aciton pic are john woo face off and barry sonnenfeld men in black both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on ni like joel schumacher more a person than an artiste ni like some of his film flatliners time to kill but lot of them suck nhe a really eccentric person and loved one of his quote about how he admits to being mediocre director and

       " 'much ballyhoo ha been made over this new version of lolita made in time when one would think that faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made over it use of pedophilia and a such it important to address it straight forwardly before any other ideal such a goodness and theme can be discussed a this film ha been in film limbo for number of year lying around in vault san distributor and having critic waiting to either hail it masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit nwhen seeing this film after all the hoopla keeping in mind that there are people namely me who are fan of the novel who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since it creation well nyou just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution nwhat even worse is that seeing this lolita especially the first time and if you re familiar with anything lolita is admittingly very anticlimactic nthis is real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film ignoring all the crap that ha preceeded it it really quite film perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne although really look at it competition flashdance fatal attraction and indecent proposal at least besides jacob ladder ni ve seen this lolita twice the first time wasn so blown away nit seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting nthe second time not really thinking about how ve waited for what seems like forever to see it and how m seeing it on tv set on premium cable channel and not giant movie theatre it really affected me emotionally nthe story itself is surprisingly heartbreaking one which is why it such good novel and why this is such good film nthe story of pedophile obsessed with young 14 year old girl named dolores k lolita is great because it not trash for the perverted but because it about human obsession with thing that are out of one reach nit protagonist the comically named humbert humbert is not your average pedophile but seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsession and idosyncrasies nthe character of lolita is almost symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology something that will destroy u but that we can live without nthese idea are all worked into this film nicely but done in way that is not heavy handed at all but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating nthe focus of this film and the reason for making it it seems wa to really penetrate the emotional depth of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic image and scene which are blatantly over stylized nthe tone of the book is comical one but it also tragic one and humbert telling the story from his perspective blow every single thing out of perspective nhumbert exists in fantsy world of his obsession and desire and this reflects the way the entire film ha been designed nwe get sense that perhaps it by doing this that humbert ha really trapped himself into fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed nhe weeps uncontrollably and never let himself get over his original 14 year old love and allows himself to embody her a lolita nhe let his feeling for her navigate all his decision and by the end he ha nothing but overly dramatic feeling for her nthe story recognizes the extreme of this almost out of test seeing if the reader will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed pervert and one almost wonder while reading the book if the author vladimir nabokov wrote the book a mean to bring into focus his own sick obsession and perhaps bring them to peace nthe weirdest thing about this film is that by the end when humbert ha reached the finale of his obsessional journey we can easily sympathize and even identify with him nthe opening and final image of the film are the same and who hasn done similar action that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but deep sadness in u nthis is the second time the novel ha been adapted for the screen the first time being filmed in shock 1962 by stanley kubrick who couldn possibly have brought the novel to the screen with a much faithfulness a lyne ha been able to do but did the next best thing he economized for everything and came up with droll black comedy about obsession in general nin that film he used the trap of society a benefit nthe studio demanded the final scene that of heinous murder come first in the film so to portray humbert first a murderer and second a pedophile and nwhen you see it it give the film depth of man trapped by obsession nthe censor wouldn allow anymore than couple glance and subtle dialogue to show the um relationship between humbert and lolita so kubrick decided to play it a comedy but still allow the tragedy to seep through nlooking at these two version especially after reading the novel and we all know that when we ve read novel and see film adaptation we are bound to be angered by any size difference it really impossible to compare them nthey both go for different thing and one ha lot more room to be a sexually frank a the novel wa nand although it true that several scene are similar and are thus up for comparison overall it unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse ni have never been one for saying the level of greatness of film adaptation of novel is deemed by how faithful it is and won say that here nhowever this film is pretty amazing mostly because hey loved the book and this film nearly reminded me of it nit doesn have nearly a much wit couple comical scene and even lot of good chuckle but just not totally witty but it doe have the same emotional toll that the novel had nsome of that is in the casting of the two lead njeremy iron with his deep soft british voice and gentle look is an amazing humbert nhe droll in very unique way and well no one can look distraught the way he doe nhe brings wonderful sympathy to the role that go beyond pathos and really come up a being easy to identify with the audience nand when he look at lolita with love and she look at him with lust you know that he her prisoner for a long a he life nand dominique swain who play the title character is rather incredible nshe pull off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original wonderfully balancing the quality of seduction bratiness and self centeredness that mark the character nit easy to see why she surrender to humbert she love the attention and know that she can have her way with him at any time nwhen he denies her something she blackmail him effortlessly scene involving rocking chair and little foot action is damn near classic and when he stand up to her she weeps and run away leaving humbert to follow her nthere are two other minor character in the film one who a road block in the beginning and the other who a reappearing threat to the relationship nthe former is charlotte lolita mother played by melanie griffith nin the book charlotte is monster of woman overbearing constantly scolding her child overly religious and ultimately selfish nand she the one obstacle humbert ha to overcome to obtain his goal at least in the beginning na played by shelly winter in the original she represented all these quality a played by griffith here she about half of them nit annoying to watch film and play game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first nand even though griffith is not really bad persay she nothing more nthe other is clare quilty the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita and succeeds but at price nlangella take totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original nquilty wa comic character in the original threat in the form of many form popping in state of rambling german proning and eventually drunk nlangella take the other route allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed and the result is character who exists in shadow and low shot and who meet wonderfully ironic ending the exact opposite of what we thought of him na you can see most of these are not improvement or mistake done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter stephen schiff but just part of whole new look at the novel at least cinema wise nthis version is beautiful and perpetually saddening nthe camera movement are stylized and each shot is breathtakingly rich nthe acting is for the most part wonderful and when we watch it we really get sense that for humbert who is telling the story the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita nmore importantly it take u right up the brink of emotion then jump right over it nby the end with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car following what he say is the only part of his life he doesn regret we feel that we all lose to something we can never have',\n",

if making an ironic self depreciating remark the movie toss in clearly marxist imagery nno no njust kidding nhad you going there for moment didn i nin all seriousness however and to be fair to the movie it is necessary to provide two viewpoint that of movie watcher unfamiliar or only marginally familiar with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon and that of fan of the first movie and or fan of the game nthe first movie mortal kombat 1995 concerned itself with martial art tournament that would decide the fate of earth and it 5 billion inhabitant nthe mortal won and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth nunfortunately shao khan wa poor loser and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway ready to take over the planet a our hero assumed fighting stance nthe first movie wa extraordinarily entertaining for those like myself who are fan of the game ni even go so far a to say that many folk who didn know about the game probably enjoyed the movie nthe writer and director knew the limitation of both their cast and of the basic story itself and they didn try to overachieve nthere were lot of really cool fight scene with really cool accompanying music intersperesed with some distracting but ultimately non intrusive bit of fluff passing itself off a plot nand a we know the movie wa smashing success at the box office nmortal kombat annihilation pick up precisely where that movie left off with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie nshao khan ha decided that he going to take over the earth anyways and to hell with some silly rule about mortal winning the tournament nthereafter follows approximately 85 minute of film that alternate between being confused being trite being silly and being just plain stupid none get the general impression that the producer of the movie thought hey that last movie wa such success that we can get more money and make real movie now ntoo bad they didn simply stick with the formula from the first movie ni could write volume about the thing that are wrong with this picture but here are the high point the acting is truly bad nsandra hess playing the sonya blade character is particularly execrable especially in scene where she try to convince u that she loved johnny cage character from the first movie who get greased at the beginning of this movie in one of the worst piece of mi casting think ve ever seen james remar play raiden the god of thunder nin the first movie christopher lambert played raiden and played his character a though he wa in on the joke french actor playing japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystic ni generally like it when actor are cast against type tim tiny lister jr being cast a the president of the s in the fifth element for example and remar ha always been one of my favorite utility actor but he so totally wrong for this part that he doesn even have the luxury of amused self awareness there are too many character that are introduced a being potentially important but then never seen again there are number of completely meaningless story sidetrack including muddled scene where liu kang robin shou seek out nightwolf litefoot ha mystical hallucination and then wanders off with jade irina pantaeva nfor these reason and many others can only give the movie 2 unless you re huge fan of the game and or the first movie nin that case the following critique also apply sandra hess while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson who played sonya blade in the first movie is much more convincing a fighter nwilson looked like she wa simply mimicing some movement taught to her by the fight choreographer nhess look like she actually know some martial art and put together much more believable fight scene in the fight each of the character doe at least one thing they do in the game and often more nsonya doe her kiss of death jax doe his earthquake liu kang doe his animality and so on na big bonus for those of u who were looking for similar move in the first movie and found them only rarely there aren a many fight scene in this movie a there were in the first because the folk making the movie mistakenly try to hang more robust plot in between nsilly silly folk nand the lamest fight involved two of the woman in what turn into mud wrestling match

liu kang in which both perform their animality nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro wa in the first movie nfor folk like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the

human being neven today all we can do is give information about dna and how it work not copy of human dna because we don have it analyzed yet nthe answer we get from the unknown alien source are plan for recreating member of the alien race and doctor xavier finch played by ben kingsley is placed in charge of the attempt nthe script begin to go off the deep end at this point when the result is beautiful young girl who can shape shift into any of several ugly alien life form nthe first half of the film ha something to offer a sil the alien girl struggle with her multi form existence changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos nshe seems oddly knowledgeable about human society with glaring gap where her social skill should be nher instinct are to mate and procreate and some of the best scene deal with her attempt in this area nescaping from her birth laboratory in utah sil is pursued by team of drafted civilian with order to find her and kill her nshe go on an eating binge spin herself cocoon and emerges a an adult played by natasha henstridge who go long way toward re creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960 nthe pursuer michael madsen is an assassin exterminator forrest whitaker is convenient empath psychic just a though the s government actually had such people on call nneither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided nwhitaker role seems to be aimed at making whitaker male copy of star trek the next generation counselor cleavage nthe other member of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina nkingsley and whitaker are both consummate professional too good to not work to the best of their ability but the performance donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland and it is apparent that the direction wa bit weak nh giger design for the main form of the alien creature is actually bit boring when we finally get to see it although previous digital effect were done quite smoothly nthe main fault of specie is lack of originality it start out with wonderful albeit borrowed premise and then doesn live up to it nall we get are chase scene and few nice sex scene with few monster tossed in nthere is no buildup of tension and suspense no climax worthy of the name specie is just sequence of scare scene stuck together nthe movie is carried by it chase and sex scene but not rescued by them non the other hand a an exercise in sci fi action adventure it certainly beat the ichor out of judge dredd nspecies earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board but by and large it fun only for those of u who really like this sort of thing nmy personal rating is three star but knock one or two of those off if you don enjoy pretty unclothed lady and bloodthirsty alien monster nmpaa classification violence gore nudity sex language

       " 'with the success of the surprise hit alien directed by ridley scott sequel wa inevitable nin fact after watching the first film sequel wa wanted particularly by this reviewer nhanding over the director chair to recent box office gem james cameron who had only made two film previous to this one pirahna ii surprisingly dull film and terminator making cameron household name the alien series got face lift of immense proportion ninstead of being suspense science fiction film cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture nwhat result is one of the most terrifying film ever created na film like alien come along only once in while and when it doe audience are usually unprepared for it ni never saw this movie in theater but wish could have nthe terror and fright must have been unimaginable most likely with audience member literally shrieking in fear naliens is an action film unlike any have ever seen nwith science fiction plot cameron give alien added testosterone pumping up the action and fire power from the original film nin fact alien is one of those few sequel which top the original nperhaps what make the alien series so impressive is the hero or heroine a the case may be nnever have we had more sympathetic hero in an action film and never have seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character nsigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for u to care about nplacing woman in these situation would sometimes seem unusual but because of weaver presence woman is the only suitable hero naliens begin 57 year after alien ended nlieutenant ellen ripley weaver is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened nshe explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the alien but the company is doubtful nthey explain that colony of family is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left ndespite stern warning from ripley the company remains rigid and won call the family back nhowever when the company loses contact with the colony ripley story seems much more feasible none of the company director carter burke paul reiser want to gather team to travel to the planet nthis team includes buff private vasquez jenette goldstein questionable corporal hick michael biehn and loyal android bishop lance henriksen nburke tag along with ripley a they fly to the planet in order to locate the member of the colony narriving on the planet the team find most of the human life extinguished in cocoon type environment nthe only survivor is 12 year old rebecca newt jorden carrie henn nripley find this chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become and she becomes newt surrogate mother nripley and newt are the only one who know what ha happened and soon all hell break loose naliens not only multiplies the thrill and suspense from scott version it also multiplies the number of alien in general nalien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member except ripley who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo naliens focus on an entire race of these alien and a result the chill are incredibly heightened nthen again this is james cameron the guy who ha given u true lie and terminator 2 judgment day nhe is the best action director out there topping renny harlin who directed cliffhanger and only he could create something a terrifying a this film nit seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scene and alien ha the motherload nwith perhaps one of the most astonishing ending ever created for an action film alien climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion ni can recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout never dropping for moment njust when you think the movie is over something else will occur and it start right back up again nwith seemingly endless conclusion alien end with one of the greatest moment in film history nthis scene is usually the one remembered most from the film a lieutenant ripley step into one of the lifting machine to fight the alien queen nusing flawless special effect the climax is exhausting leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety nof course for film of this genre to work properly the technical aspect must be realistic enough for u to believe what we see naliens is completely realistic even decade after it initial release nthe special effect are wonderfully seamless with terrifying alien to go with them none of the most overlooked aspect of this film is the music composed by cameron regular james horner nhorner ha created terrific score receiving an oscar nomination for his work nnot only that horner ha also created one of the best score for any action film or science fiction film ever and that includes 2001 space odyssey which wa mainly compilation of well known composer nin fact the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music nthe production design is incredible which also happened to snag nomination from the academy ndark corridor lit by red light are very impressive but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well lit location nnormally film will be very dark in order to scare viewer alien us light to scare the viewer nthen of course is the cinematography which us point of view shot along with video feed in order to build suspense nsome of the scariest scene involve the perspective of ripley nsurprisingly the acting is not only above average for this genre but some of the best nsigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard edged persona nweaver soar above the rest in this film but she is supposed to ncarrie henn give an above average performance for child developing three dimensional character from her quiet attitude nlance henriksen is terrific a bishop showing that android don always have to be flat character njenette goldstein show fair amount of enthusiasm with her role and steal several scene of her own though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn fighting nmichael biehn give very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film nhowever biehn doe good job making it seem original again npaul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director but reiser manages to pull it off quite well however still see him a paul on tv mad about you na very good cast which also includes bill paxton and william hope highlight this action film making it stand out from others naliens is rightfully rated for violence gore language and terror naliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre a alien wa more of suspense horror film naliens pump up the stake and cameron directs it with professional quality ncameron certainly know how to make good action film but here he prof how he can create some truly horrific moment on screen ntechnically astonishing alien only flaw is small character who are only there to get killed naside from this you probably won experience anything like alien for quite while',\n",

       " 'one of the biggest cliche of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable nyou know the one where the detective look at wall of picture and other police information and suddenly spot the clue which reveals who the killer is nsure it been used over and over but for some reason it is always fun to watch nthis cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girl work on overused but always fun none of my personal rule about watching film is not how original the film is but how it go around giving it story nthis rule applies highly to kiss the girl nthere is something psychologically stimulating in well crafted serial killer movie and kiss the girl is certainly well made nhowever the whole film scream of unoriginality and so it relies on the power of it actor and the technical detail to pull it through nwell not only are the actor capable of pulling it through but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up nunfortunately one of the most revealing and rather insulting choice by the filmmaker one that seven film lot like this one knew not to make wa to put the name of the killer in the opening credit nthat may give the actor credit for the role but throughout the film hidden in my mind wa waiting for him to appear on screen which spoiled the mystery nhowever credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film nplotwise kiss the girl show almost no originality nwe are introduced to detective alex cross morgan freeman forensic psychologist and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him a the hero nhe get call about woman who ha shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself nobviously cross succeeds at getting the gun but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene nat his house cross is told that his neice naomi gina ravera ha been missing for four day nthis provides the motivation for cross to find the killer but we are never given chance to establish the relationship between the two and a result we can sympathize with detective cross nhowever what make kiss the girl slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees nbefore she is abducted ndr kate mctiernan ashley judd the actress of the judd family is smart athletic woman and because of these trait becomes target for casanova what the serial killer like to call himself nbecause of these character developing scene we care for mctiernan making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful nafter being abducted mctiernan wake up and find herself in cell somewhere in the wood nremembering that the killer gave her certain rule she decides to break one of them by calling out nwhen casanova come to punish her she break out and escape by jumping over waterfall nafter she is found she begin to help cross find his neice nfrom this moment on kiss the girl take on the form of every other serial killer film a the two lead search for the rest of the victim held captive nmany people will compare this film to 1995 seven another killer film starring morgan freeman but presume that the similarity are intentional nthe screenplay by david klass is adapted from the novel written by james patterson and yet don quite see how this story could have worked in novel form nwhat make kiss the girl so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness nthe cinematography by aaron schneider is reminiscient of seven and sometimes felt that many of the shot were trying too hard to impress u nsometimes simple shot is the best one nhowever many of the shot are stunning and unlike seven most of them take place during the day in sunlight nthe scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done in more than one way nthe camera work is terrific but the editing make this scene work so well nthe chaotic and mtv type cutting give the audience sense of confusion and unawareness exactly what judd character is experiencing nhowever the best aspect of kiss the girl is it actor nmorgan freeman is one of today most powerful and believable actor ndetective cross is very good character for him although it is just similar one to the character in seven nbecause of freeman powerful presence he carry half the film by himself nthe other half is carried by ashley judd one of today most promising dramatic actress nin fact her performance is better than freeman if that is even possible nher character is more original than freeman and she handle it wonderfully nwe finally have female character in movie like this who doe more than just scream nthe supporting cast is highly underdeveloped but the cast member do a much a they can with it ncary elwes portrays cop in north carolina and unfortunately ha scrap for character ntony goldwyn fair slightly better but we don really get to know his character either ngina ravera give good performance but again she isn in many of the scene nso a result of all these small supporting part the weight of the film lie on the two lead and they do phenomenal job nsome of the best acting of this genre and some of the best acting of the year ntwo other essential aspect of the film are quite good ndirector gary fleder doe good job of controlling his actor but the second half of the film loses believability especially during the revelation of the killer nhe also doesn handle the suspenseful scene a better director would have losing lot of tension during many scene nhowever to his credit he doe manage terrific first half npart of the blame fall on david klass ni sure the book developed many of the lesser character more but klass focus on the two main part nwhile this may give the two lead more screentime many of the small character are one dimensional and the killer when revealed is extremely implausible nthanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel kiss the girl always seems intelligent nnone of the conversation are laughable and all move the plot forward without seeming forced none of the biggest problem had with the movie wa the motive of the killer ni blame this mainly on the casting director because the killer motive is because of rejection from woman or so assume from the opening monologue but the killer himself is very attractive one of my friend is shall we say big admirer of the killer nkiss the girl is rated for terror violence language and suggested sex nwith all the implausibility of this film and with the mediocre second half kiss the girl somehow manages to thoroughly entertain nin fact had the urge to see it again just for the performance nthe cinematography add lot of mood to the already creepy tone and the script is usually smart nthis is clearly one of those movie which rely on the acting to pull it through nmorgan

       " 'it ha been three long year since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival palme or 100 million plus box office gross and an oscar nomination all for his sophomore outing pulp fiction nsince then the talented film maker ha been virtually invisible surfacing briefly a co director of the wildly uneven four room and the screenwriter of the gory vampire fest from dusk till dawn nin between he ha moonlighted a an actor with several decidedly unmemorable performance nnow with much fanfare and anticipation tarantino ha returned with his third directorial effort jackie brown nand while this motion picture adapted from elmore leonard novel rum punch offer solid entertainment those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theater disappointed nfor the most part jackie brown is pretty ordinary crime movie nthe story which start out slowly develops into twisty affair with double cross and triple cross nand the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademark witty dialogue unexpected gunfire 70 pop tune and close ups of woman bare foot nyet for all of that the production is something of letdown nthe sheer in your face exuberance that marked reservoir dog and especially pulp fiction is absent nthe mostly straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn match up favorably to the non linear style of tarantino previous effort an approach that added tension and edginess to the narrative nand there aren nearly a many deliciously offbeat conversation this time around nthere a samuel jackson monologue about gun jackson chris tucker argument regarding the merit of hiding in car trunk and jackson robert de niro exchange that recall some of the jackson travolta material from pulp fiction but that about it njackie brown lone innovation is it presentation of crucial sequence from three different perspective nthis isn exactly an original technique it ha been done numerous time before most famously in akira kurosawa rashomon and most recently in edward zwick courage under fire nhowever while in those two movie and others there wa legitimate plot reason for the multiple point of view tarantino sole purpose for using it appears to be because it unconventional nhad the scene in question been shown from only one of the three vantage nothing would have been lost na result this aspect of the film is little more than curiosity nfor the second picture in row tarantino is attempting to revive the career of 70 icon nthis time around instead of john travolta it blaxploitation queen pam grier foxy brown ha become jackie brown nin one of many nod to the most famous segment of grier career tarantino us 70 song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credit nthere are also several instance during jackie brown when the director offer sly wink towards certain convention of the blaxploitation genre although grier never doe any butt kicking ngrier is jackie brown flight attendant who get caught transporting drug and money into the united state nshe working for gun dealer ordell robbie samuel jackson but she keep her mouth shut under questioning despite pressure from ray nicolet michael keaton federal official nno longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie ordell arranges for bail bondsman max cherry robert forster tv banyon to post the necessary 10 000 then plan to shoot jackie if she prof disloyal njackie pass ordell test however and soon the two of them are plotting way to smuggle 500 000 of ordell money into the united state without tipping off the fed nsoon just about everyone is after that money including jackie max ray ordell perpetually oversexed and drugged out girlfriend melanie bridget fonda and his right hand man louis robert de niro nunsurprisingly the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel jackson but ordell isn nearly a invigorating or compelling character a jules from pulp fiction nin addition to looking fantastic pam grier is also quite good although hers is not an oscar caliber performance although she might get nomination nrobert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough guy who rarely smile role nbridget fonda is around for three discernible reason to look sexy in bikini to provide little twisted comedy and to satisfy tarantino foot fetish nrobert de niro is criminally underused in part that could have been played equally well by any grungy looking middle aged actor nthe film which clock in at several minute over the two and half hour mark is probably too long for the material but the plot is convoluted enough to keep u guessing throughout although the payoff is letdown ntarantino keep thing moving along nicely with heavier dose of humor and le violence than in pulp fiction but on the whole this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabe than something from the director himself nwhen it come to recent caper film like the grifter and bound jackie brown is second tier effort nit an entertaining diversion but not masterpiece and certainly not an oscar contender',\n",

unstable rounder is exactly the kind of movie parent don want their kid to see nit not that it a drunken orgy of sex and violence but because it a film that flat out say you can make career out of gambling nand to take make thing worse it prof this through it original fascinating story nthere have been countless crime film both past and present that evoke the noir mood that is the dark shady atmosphere where the vice of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life nthis film start off in the tradiational noir style introducing u to the underworld of modern gambling where the stake are high and so is the price for losing nmatt damon star a mike mcdermott 20 something law student in present day new york city who tell u how the game of poker is really played ndamon narrates throughout the film but the entire opening scene is voiced over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting nmike about to go up against teddy kgb malkovich russian gangster who look like serial killer nbut then again he practically is one and the film doe everything to convey that sense the look in his eye his slow movement his intricate mannerism all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld literally ndamon in the flesh might seem little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly groomed feature but his narration is what brings it all together nhe never sound like he reading from script nor that he trying to embellish anything it just come natural to him nthe screenwriter use the right word and phrase to describe the mood from the smell of the air to the logic involved in reading the other guy face and card and all without sounding remotely trite nimmediately we get the sense that poker isn for gambler but for near genius with nerve of steel nthe game is quiet war with strategy just a complex and the same sense of honor among the soldier nthe gangster mike play against are the same one that might kill someone for scratching their car but when it come to the game of poker all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man nthe film doe an excellent job in establishing it atmosphere during the first act nit concentrate so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble bit nwe learn only little about mike both past and present npresently we know he ha girlfriend named jo gretchen mol who he constantly argues with over his gambling nthey go through few break up make up cycle until mike childhood pal and fellow rounder worm norton is released from prison nit not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollar to the mob but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such predictable element and execute it the way it doe ntechnically the plot isn unlike many child sitcom in which the good kid bad friend get the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friend with the bad kid nwhat this film doe is use different medium to tell that story nmike and worm have been in over their head their entire life but both share passion for out thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them nwhere a worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating hence his jail time mike always take the card he dealt and work with them nsometimes they pay off e nhis ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money but other time they don i nthe fact he take himself out of the game and work steady job after dropping 30 000 on single hand nonce thing start happening the film is able to expand and develop it plot into an intricate web of detail and mood nmike and worm bob and weave through all kind of game at all kind of place from socialite mansion to taking the tourist at atlantic city to outwitting the gangster that control it all neverything they come into contact with is big poker game in that everything a battle against the card destiny deal none scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by judge martin landou in perfectly cast and performed role that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time nmatt good at gambling but he also got potential to be great lawyer nhe could go professional a either but with one he could lose everything or win big but with the other there stability but not much risk involved ncan someone who gambled his entire life really cash in his chip and leave nif the film had been just subtle lesson in poker playing then the ending is our test neverything is told from mike perspective but we re finally able to recognize some thing on our own nthis make the final against all odds showdown seem like just that nit work just like the game it revolves around showing u some of the card but still evokes the element of the unknown and the consequence thereof nwhat separate rounder from most other film about game is the fact the challenge and the skill are more important

together to hate others such a the jew nif harmon wa merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be then apologize for being so harsh on element of his film but it is presented so mean spiritedly that can help but feel like he had some serious intent na for the entire central theme of the movie m afraid that it one that just don get ni tried to keep an open mind while watching it but the homosexual element were just too prevalent for my taste nit wa hard enough to watch them bash other race and sex without them preaching about the virtue of being homosexual and accepted by society nhow doe one expect to be accepted if they are just a guilty of non acceptance ni not prone to judging anyone and believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenue they wish free from the scornful eye of society but don force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren going to show the same respect for my preference that you wish from me nagain maybe m missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make but if so think it could have been handled little more tactfully na far a musical comedy go isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical but good portion of the song are maddeningly catchy ndespite the disturbing visuals mom and apple pie stuck with me for the rest of the day nspeaking of disturbing visuals wedding bell ain ringing could have been decent song but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying i a lesbian which is touted in the press release a being particularly popular is also pretty good but good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of m smith nit mainly on her excellent vocal that my rating of this film is based nthe other performer are decent save for the rosie donnell like performance given by danica sheridan ni have no inherent problem with her character it is just her singing voice that leaf little to be desired none particular musical number lesbian rock wa one of the lowest point have ever experienced in my film going life thanks to strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan nthe film end about twenty minute before the credit actually roll nthe remainder of the running time is padded out with few more song lesbian rock included and the ridiculously presented anti nuke message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it feature length film nonce the isle of lesbos reprise wa reached felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all nwhy wa the film needlessly stretched out past it obvious end nisle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www indie underground com nthe transfer is pretty clean and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrop are readily apparent and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 85 1 nin many respect isle of lesbos ha incredible cult potential like rocky horror for the new millennium nthis film is by no mean my cup of tea but

and glory 1987 the slightly over conceived arthurian epic excalibur 1981 and the father son jungle adventure the emerald forest 1985 nhis film all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination but sometimes that come at the cost of coherence and taste nif boorman is anything he ambitious and when he succeeds it in grand fashion nunfortunately the bigger they are the harder they fall and when boorman fall the resounding impact can be heard for mile around zardoz is meant to take it place among the grandest of mystical movie an obsession of boorman nhis screenplay try to elicit the same mythological connotation of the arthurian legend or even the wizard of oz book which figure into the movie plot nbut despite all this reaching the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling nthe event take place in the distant year 2293 but there is little of the typical futuristic movie ness to be found nin fact thing seems to have moved backwards with people riding horse shooting old style gun and living in large victorian mansion nit more middle age than space age nthe world of zardoz is divided into two distinct hemisphere the outlands where all the poor pathetic people live and the vortex where select group of wealthy intellectual live in comfort and everlasting life nthese immortal never grow old they never engage in sexual activity they posse psychological power and they live in sort of quasi utopian marxist society where everyone is equal and everyone contributes equally to the society nhowever if one break the rule that person is punished by being aged so many year nif someone break the rule enough he or she is aged to the point of senility and imprisoned to an eternal existence in geriatric home with others aged criminal none of the immortal arthur frayn niall buggy squirmy man with mustache and goatee tattooed on his face is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the resident to farm so the immortal can be fed nlike the wizard of oz he adopts god like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in giant stone carved like menacing head this flying head is one of the movie opening image and it a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come ncalling himself zardoz frayn gather bunch of outlander and make them into group called the exterminator whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlander so they can procreate and take up more resource nfrom inside his giant stone head zardoz bellow seriously laugh inducting statement like the gun is good nthe penis is evil nthat line alone is worth the movie cult following none day an exterminator named zed sean connery sneak into zardoz flying stone push frayn out and go back to the vortex nonce there the immortal label him brutal and study him like lab rat taking great perverse care in exploring his sexuality which is mystery to them nthey seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection and there is one downright hilarious sequence where bunch of scantily clad female scientist show zed erotic footage on video screen in an attempt to determine what get him worked up ni say hilarious because that is exactly what zardoz is nit is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so he made this film with the straightest of face although have hard time believing that a production moved forward he didn get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it wa becoming njust looking at connery is enough to give one the giggle he spends most of the film running around in red loin cloth that resembles diaper mane of hair braided halfway down his back wyatt earp style handlebar mustache and pair of thigh high patent leather boot that would look more appropriate on cheap hollywood hooker nboorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of deliverance which is the only reason can imagine studio would green light this effort nhe attracted some rich talent on both side of the camera including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth 2001 whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in zardoz besides the inadvertent humor nsean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 and perhaps he wa looking for change in pace nhe got exactly that in zardoz and it a wonder it didn end his career ni sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statement ni it treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ni it condemnation of those who consider growing old to be bad thing nor is it social statement something about the inherent negativity of class distinction and the violence it creates nkarl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary ncome to think of it maybe boorman made it a an extended lsd trip npeople high on illicit substance are the only one can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness a anything more than completely unintentional comedy',\n",

       " 'many people dislike french film for their lack of closure nwhile possibly shallow ve often had desire for sense of epiphany or at least resolution in the film which view nthere is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional however the film is incredibly successful in it passionate dramatization of passion denying protagonist stephane daniel auteuil nstephane daniel auteuil is master violin maker nhe is passionless about all that which surround him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing neven the relationship between he and his bos maxime andre dussollier is controlled and almost manipulated association highlighted by the fact that stephane permit maxime to win close squash match nin the beginning of the movie stephane is closed solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man ncamille kessler emmanuelle beart is master violinist and the new love of maximes nmaxime is so much in love with camille that he plan to and doe leave his wife nlike stephane camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges nwhen stephane and camille meet there is recognition of bonding by both individual nhowever whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotion which she now feel for stephane stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him nstephane ignores his feeling for camille which the audience cannot help but to see is present na the movie progress the two character become more and more polarized in their view and emotion for one another nthese two people with very similar approach to life initially react to their new circumstance very differently nstephane becomes even more rational and controlled while camille becomes more tempestuous until she almost border on suffering nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship nhowever their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation nthe audience is led to believe that stephane may have been genius a violinist a well due to his relationship with master violin teacher nhowever apparently he could not be violinist due to his intolerance for flaw in his playing nconsequently stephane becomes precision craftsman with the instrument and no longer play nin contrast camille had almost given the violin year earlier nhowever with the aid of her manager she ha progressed to being almost one of the world finest successfully submerging herself to her playing nduring the course of the movie we see both character evolve a they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotion nstephane attempt to remain unchanged nhowever we do see subtle hint of his transformation none of the most obvious is when he defeat maxime in squash nthe development of all of the character many of which is not included in this synopsis is incredible namerican movie with rare exception have not and would daresay cannot approach foreign film in character development nin it essence this movie is about the development and growth of the character camille and stephane nthe portrayal of all the other character in the movie including death is to further the development of camille and stepahne character ni am not sure why berardinelli say at time it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified and it is to auteuil credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty nthis movie is not about judging stephane action a being right or wrong but about viewing their growth and accepting the character a who they are ni find the ending appropriate unfortunately found the last ten minute which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling nthis portion of the film is where the sense of closure could have been successfully accomplished nunfortunately there is hurried and almost soap opera type surge of emotion from all of the character nwhile ravel may not be quite a accomplished a schubert or mozart ravel ha his day in this film nthe synergism of the tension of ravel music and tension on the screen is the best have ever seen nthe directing in this movie is wonderful nthe actor and actress are excellent each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth nemmanuelle beart personality is beautiful nand needle to say must say that emmanuelle beart herself is beautiful nbesides the near ending the only other criticism of the movie which have is that the movie is almost too cerebral ni almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the change which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyche and little in their personality or the situation which they end a part of nthe one question which am left with is while they have accepted their lot ha their attitude towards love changed ni have several possibility which believe the movie hint at but am unsure of which the director is espousing nin summary this movie is solely about the character growth of two character who almost develop relationship nin the process we see their attitude towards life and other people nin itself do not believe un coeur is complicated movie nwhere it doe become complicated is when we juxtapose the scene of the movie into the greater walk of life where we a american have preconceived american notion of relationship love and people ni do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within it native french culture nhowever bringing my american preconception enjoyed the film ni would welcome any comment about this movie from any who have seen it',\n",

moviegoer stretched around the block some anticipant having queued up well in advance to get good seat in the theater nthey need not have wasted their time nthe movie is billed a comedy but is surprisingly bereft of humor nthere are noticeable attempt at laugh but very few try actually click ni wondered if there were joke that wasn getting because m not from china but unfortunately my conclusion wa that this lack of humor couldn be attributed to the cultural barrier either nkeep cool just isn very funny nthe prelude to the film wa visit by keep cool producer who with the help of an interpreter regaled u of how in order to get the print to the festival in time an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii nalthough the print made it the assistant luggage wa lost ntoo bad that story wasn in the movie because it got big laugh nqu ying the film female lead wa also on hand to give few comment nhowever whereas the producer politely made regular pause in his dialog so the interpreter could bring u up to speed m ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one fast paced incredibly long tirade nit wa dizzying good foreshadowing for the film nyou see keep cool is filmed almost totally with camera handheld by man with bad case of the shake nat least that the way it seems since the camera is constantly moving ncinema verite is one thing but panning and shaking around until your audience ha headache is another nalthough some might consider it form which help give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing found it thoroughly distracting and after while quite annoying nheadache a said nthe film is about young bookseller wen jiang who is after young woman qu ying nthey used to be romantically involved but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship nthe first half of the film is about the young man plan to win her back nof course the thing is she doesn want to be won back and ha nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up bit nin the fight the young man grab laptop computer belonging to bystander and attempt to use it to fend off his attacker but only end up smashing it against lamppost nwe later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wish to get his damaged computer replaced nthere is funny scene the only one in the film where the young man try to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner baotian li in order to recoup his loss nthere is no sense to be made out of the young woman behavior cold one minute caring the next so we feel no sympathy for her character nthe bookseller would be better off without her nalthough the second half of the film cause u to lose lot of sympathy for the young bookseller a well who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner hand a revenge for the beating he took it also offer u some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man nwhile the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge the older man is the voice of reason and try to rationalize each situation nhis quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to brick wall half the time na friendship develops between the two men but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate nalthough only an hour and half in length keep cool contains extraneous material nthe whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out since we don see her from the midpoint on na case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served a the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner and would have saved u from the bookseller boring pursuit during the first half nbut of course this would have shortened the movie to le than an hour nthere are few thing that keep cool doe right na mentioned before the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good nalthough it grows tiresome the reasoning with the unreasonable is nice exercise in logic and represents the difference in thinking between generation nin one scene for example the bookseller quote confucius to get his point across but the older man claim the quote wa misinterpreted and that it mean something entirely different nalso effective is the way zhang set up tension within scene such a when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner nthe nightclub owner is counting out money slapping each bundle of currency on the table nwith every shot of his hand we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge nunfortunately these crumb are not enough to overcome the rest of the film shortcoming and weren enough to prevent that headache from lingering after left the theater',\n",

think of nfrequently get the feeling that the article sounded exciting but am being told in more detail than really wanted to know noften get to the middle of story and say ok it sounded good but now have invested more time than am willing to spend on this subject nfilm is different medium nit is visual medium nthat slows down the telling of story much more than people realize ni frequently am surprised to find out how short film script is and how much of the page are empty space nthe magazine article and the film script are two very different medium nthe insider is film adaptation of the vanity fair article the man who knew too much by marie brenner nit is too much an adaptation of magazine article slowed to the pace of film nit really verge on being tedious at least at time nfor year the seven big company knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused host of unhealthy side effect nbut they pretended for the public that it wa unproven and they did not really believe it nthe business wa incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movement against big tobacco nthe tide turned when former vice president of one of the company wa convinced by the cbs 60 minute news team to tell the public how much the tobacco company really knew about the health effect of smoking nthe resulting pressure to stop the story created small civil war at cbs nwho were the major people involved what were their motif how wa the story almost killed how did it get aired anyway nthat is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider nthis all could have been enthralling but it is not the sort of thing that stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well nand in the end he failed nto make long story

style and how they get the upper hand nthey go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hand of the terrorist to the actual interview with mike wallace played by christopher plummer nthere the news team under producer lowell bergman al pacino are ordering around the terrorist and getting away with it nthis seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorist we have wry irony on who really ha clout in the world nterrorists can grab the headline but the tobacco company have the real position of power nincongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand russell crowe dejectedly returning from work to his home nwe discover that he ha been fired and his career brought to complete halt unexpectedly nhe had been very profitably rewarded vice president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco now he wa unemployed and needed money to support his family nrather than support him his wife liane diane venora demand of him what are they supposed to do for income nmeanwhile the 60 minute team trying to do story on fire started by cigarette have obtained some data they do not understand nthey offer wigand 12 000 just to interpret the data nwigand severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he know about tobacco dealing but he is reluctantly he stretch the severance term nhe is willing to read some document from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman nin spite of the secrecy wigand former employer seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minute and he is warned off by former bos thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role nand so the game begin nwigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer nmeanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family nthe film examines wigand and the pressure placed on his family a they are caught between two powerful giant nwigand ha always wanted to make tobacco safer and ha natural sympathy with getting the story out nhe and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost legal fight nal pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider nthe story is told slowly and in just bit too much meticulous detail nthe film is 157 minute and is an extremely demanding film for the audience nthe musical score by pieter bourke lisa gerrard and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory nit put ominous chord under some scene and using voice in way that become distraction that get in the way of the storytelling nalso disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer a mike wallace nplummer and wallace are such different type and wallace is too well known for even so good an actor a plummer to play him convincingly nthis film might have been really engaging experience under another director control nmichael mann wa the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lack intensity because of his style ni rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the 4 to 4 scale',\n",

dull dull dull dull who having trouble at home because he hasn gotten over his brother ethan embry in quick flash so you don recognize him did suicide the renegade girl rachel katie holmes from dawson creek who chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring and by far the most interesting kid gavin nick stahl the kid from the man without face who the most interesting because he the only

show hard pure evidence to steve he only treated a typical raving conspiracy buff nhere we have another case of the idiot plot where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him but he may have saved this film from being the dreary dull film that it is without gavin who give it life and humor nthe only other half interesting character is the school janitor played by william sadler a retarded scary guy who may not be what he seems to be but nreally we don care anyway ni probably shouldn mention that this wa directed by david nutter who work for the file because that would probably tarnish his reputation nlike the show he good at setting up weird conspiracy and creating general creepy feel nmost of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadow

       " 'note some may consider portion of the following text to be spoiler nbe forewarned nmilos forman first film since the ill fated valmont columbia the people v nlarry flynt is vastly entertaining if not particularly enlightening biopic of hustler publisher and self made millionaire larry flynt who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech right in the united state in the late 1970s and early 1980s nthe film unweaves it tale in chronological order we open with young and dirt poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy peddling jar of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky ncut to forward in time where the two flynt brother now young men are running the struggling hustler go go club in cincinnati nthe strip club are in dire financial state and in last ditch effort to salvage the operation flynt decides to go to print shop and churn out promotional newsletter nthis evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine creating larry flynt vast financial empire and the rest is history nwhat set flynt apart from other publisher is his struggle against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material and who railed and preached against him flynt spent time in incarceration and wa paralyzed by an assassination attempt and his driven single minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression regardless of personal cost nthe people v nlarry flynt also weave in the bittersweet story of flynt true love althea leasure whom he meet a dancer in his club and later marries and who devotedly stand alongside him throughout his trial and tribulation nconsidering the serious nature of the film theme the importance of the united state first amendment the people v nlarry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light hearted and humourous nmuch of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt outlandish stunt at his courtroom appearance some of his chosen apparel is hilarious and for the most part these element of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic point such a an uninspiring flynt monologue set at free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity nthe film focus is on the flynt many battle over first amendment right and freedom of speech but the heart of the people v nlarry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea nlarry flynt is shown a being occassionally gruff harsh and overtly aggressive with his friend and colleague but with althea we see his loving affectionate side nthere a scene where flynt tenderly take his ill wife on ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking nultimately the emotional power that the film hit at it conclusion come not from his achievement from his battle against censor but from the strength of flynt and althea love for each other nwoody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly career topping performance a the irrepressible larry flynt nharrelson play flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience and very compelling protagonist for the film ncourtney love play althea leasure in startling turn completely raw and impulsive nit a very solid performance brash and naturalistic and love is extremely compelling it difficult to take your eye off her onscreen and her chemistry with harrelson is dead on nedward norton a flynt straight level headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co star in the people v nlarry flynt much a his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman wa upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scene but norton shine in his big scene where he address the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film none can sense the frustration that norton character feel when harrelson free talking flynt sabotage trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind and this result in heightened emotional punch when norton isaacman ha the opportunity to sway the supreme court judge nmilos forman keep the film moving although it run over two hour it never drag and his direction of the film is very effective eliciting great deal of empathy for subject which could be construed by some a extremely sordid and unsympathetic nthere also great visual technique which forman us to indicate the passing of time in one shot which is both clever and extremely entertaining ntwo minor quibble with the film it certainly seems like the people v nlarry flynt is in rush to get to it main theme with flynt battling against authority and the system for his freedom of speech nconsequently the first thirty minute of the film introducing and setting up the character seem unduly rushed perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these character are so interesting but felt it would have worked better if this route wa taken in more leisurely fashion nit also felt like there wa distinctive lack of insight into the inner working of these character the film clearly show what flynt althea isaacman and rev jerry faldwell did and on superficial level some of their motivation but it never seemed like one could really understand the character on deeper level nfor example why larry flynt wa compelled by ruth carter stapleton president carter sister to be born again is mystery to me nthen again perhaps it wa to him a well nthese two point don detract greatly from the film nthe people v nlarry flynt is certainly among the very best studio released film of 1996 and work both a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depth to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression and a touching love story',\n",

priest ian holm and mysterious creature named leeloo milla jovovich nall of the piece come together in tidy and somewhat underwhelming and unsurprising fashion but there is no denying that this basic story hold some intrinsic interest nwhat remains interesting and exciting however after brief glimpse is the fascinating world besson ha created with production designer dan weil director of photography thierry arbogast visual effect supervisor mark stetson and the crew at digital domain nthe look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moment to the last nthe frenzied cityscape of new york with it vibrant day glo color tall building penetrating high into the cloud and the swarm of car cab and other vehicle flying through labyrinthian skyway is absolutely breathtaking to

home in besson futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film nwhile besson bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film it also could be it biggest obstacle to reaching mass audience nfor all it imagination certain thing about the film may be bit too quirky and bizarre ni really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film ruby rhod chris tucker flamboyant disc jockey who make dennis rodman look conservative he make raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress sporting blonde hairdo in the shape of hair dryer speaking in high pitch at rapid fire speed nat first this character hyper energy is funny but the act wear out it welcome very quickly nnot irritating but just a strange is musical number by blue skinned alien chanteuse diva maiwenn lebesco who sings and dance an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno nthe tune a with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra innovative score is haunting but it is also completely jarring nthen there are the campy touch of humor besson and co scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout which too often are silly and forced comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny to boot nthe story weakness shine through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element nwhile still visually and aurally spectacular the event detailed are not a exciting nor powerful a they should be nthe big serious dramatic climax wa met with more than few snicker and it ambitiously strives for profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward na such at the end there is sense that there wa something bigger at work here that there wa still more left to be said about this story and these character nthis suspicion wa confirmed by besson himself who told me in the lobby following the screening imagine that the filmmaker watching the film with the enemy the critic that what had made it to the screen wa really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half now titled mr shadow is still waiting to be made nstill despite the story problem the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson rarely doe filmmaker original vision come to the screen in all it audacious

and jake lloyd jingle all the way a young anakin skywalker nif you ve read any review you ve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy nyou also may have heard that this one too kiddie friendly and doesn have enough content for adult nbelieve the hype nthe effect are stunning the digitalized creature are amazingly realistic the lightsaber duel are amazing and queen amidala sumptuous robe are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth nbut there something missing here and it isn budget or effect it everything money can buy nthe actor struggle a best they can to flesh out broad stroked and flat character nthe most successful at this is liam neeson who a qui gon jinni jedi master to young obi wan kenobi ha quiet dignity and wise commanding presence nhe is the anchor to this movie a he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out nportman queen amidala and mcgregor obi wan kenobi don fare nearly so well namidala the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation come off a stoic stilted and caricatured it appears a though she wa vulcan geisha in former life nand obi wan although mcgregor make him very endearing ha so little screen time that he nothing but robin to qui gon jinni batman nhowever mcgregor doe struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with spark of genuine insight and humanity and he doe good job nhe also absolutely nail alec guiness obi wan in episode 4 6 scottish accent and that really make his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise nin fact lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite bit and that one of the problem with this film ni would never call myself star war fan especially not considering what it mean to be fanatic these day but ve always enjoyed the film along with everyone else in america nhowever if you are the one person in america who hasn seen the film at all or even recently or who doesn bother to brush up on the name of obscure character you may be hopelessly lost nfor example one of the film main nefarious character is senator palpatine nfor those of you not recently steeped in star war trivia emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who wa darth vader master in return of the jedi and empire strike back nso obviously his appearance in phantom menace is meant to stir some echo of his later role in the series thus making his role here more meaningful na lot of the movie is like that nr2 d2 and 3po make token appearance and it obvious that lucas is banking on the audience pre existing fondness for them nbecause he doesn do much to add to it in any way nsame go for jabba the hutt who doesn look a much mean here a he doe corpulent and lazy neven planet make foreshadowing guest appearance in this film tatooine the desert world where luke grew up coruscant the cloud city from empire strike back and alderaan leia home planet which we never actually see that get blown up in star war show up or are mentioned briefly in passing nwhat the result of tying so many plot point and character to future film nthe answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty nthere no meat no substance that make you want to love the character a they are not a they will be nanother problem is that there are actually too many alien character in the film ni wa distracted by the fact that two of the main evil character strange looking alien who looked like gila monster had mouth that barely moved making them look more like muppets than actual character nand jar jar binks silly roger rabbitish amphibious character is intended a comic relief but what he really becomes is annoying and fast nunlike chewbacca and 3po who got their humanity if you ll pardon the expression from their interaction with the human character jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind at time making the movie seem like nothing more than very expensive teenage mutant ninja turtle nfurthermore the dialogue is often stilted and corny and sometimes downright infantile thereby rendering some character into nothing more than bystander to the plot noddly this isn just my judgment lucas ha said that he designed this film for kid nwell he done good job nthe hero of this film of course is young anakin but it wa very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight year old boy nthat not jake lloyd fault though he doe good job of being cute kid which is apparently all lucas asked of him nthat another mistake of course because the cute tyke becomes darth vader nwarning spoiler ahead nin my opinion there wa not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin future evil in the film nthe boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheek and there nothing more than spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie nhe ha doting mother pernilla august making her first english language film and is slave to gross flying gnome on tatooine nbut the only indication the audience get that this kid isn all heart and rose is yoda hesitation in allowing him to train a jedi under qui gon jinni nhis explanation his future is clouded warning major spoiler ahead nenter at your own risk nof course the noble qui gon dy at the hand of darth maul scary looking sith lord who excels at the jedi art but ha turned to the dark side nthis dude ha maybe two line in the entire movie but he establishes his presence through his amazing move with his double sided lightsaber and his scary facial makeup nbecause qui gon never get chance to train the young anakin in the way of the force obi wan qui gon young padawan apprentice one level below knightdom must take over the training himself nso at the end of the movie we end where the saga actually begin with obi wan kenobi and his young apprentice anakin darth vader skywalker ndid this story need to be told ni would say no nbut is it worthwhile movie to see nabsolutely nif you don enter the theater with jedi size expectation and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle then this is your movie nthe tatooine pod race are triumph of effect and computer animation nthe digitalized background on some of the planet are an astonishing sight nand yoda and young obi wan are worth seeing for their origin in simpler happier time nabove all this is fun movie nnot deep not meaningful and not profound nbut fun nmaybe next time lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co write the script and the guy who directed empire will direct nbecause if lucas doe the next one himself it will be lacking the one thing it need the most potential n',\n",

       " 'let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film really wasn looking forward to it a much a have with some of the previous film ni not sure if it wa the fairly lackluster trailer or the ever present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable way of the timothy dalton year ni happy to report that any doubt were erased after about the first 10 minute of the film nby that point it wa evident that mr bond wa back with vengeance nall doubt would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minute of the film weren exactly pleasant experience nit seems that nobody told the genius working at the theater that the house light are supposed to be turned off when the movie start nit took reminder from an audience member to clue them in ni guess they can be excused though taking ticket and cleaning up popcorn between show is extremely taxing on the brain nanyway after somebody remembered what the light switch wa for settled in for bond ni think the most noticeable aspect of this the 19th film in the series is that it really go back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore film nthere were probably more one liner in this movie than in the last several combined nand bond last one liner in the film is about the best of the series nthe world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series neverything from wild boat chase to the usual assortment of cool bond gadget trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 nfor the most part the action sequence worked very well nalthough there were couple of time that thought some thing were bit over the top even for bond film ni think some of the blame can be laid at the foot of director michael apted nwhile he did good job for the most part there were point in the movie specifically during action sequence that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he wa making essentially an action film nmost noticeably sequence on snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through closing door looked like apted thought he wa filming some sort of high brow art movie nhe almost seemed like he didn know what he wa doing nbut they were brief scene and really shouldn take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing nif you have ever seen bond film you won be shocked to learn that plot ha never been their strong suit nthe world is not enough is no exception nthis time we have yet another over villain that bond ha to stop for the good of the world n007 match wit with the terrorist renard robert carlyle man who ha bullet lodged in his brain that make him impervious to pain nwhy this point is included is beyond me nthey took great pain to explain his condition but it only came up later in the movie a scene that can only be described a looking like an afterthought nanyway renard like the typical terrorist that he is is bent on some harebrained scheme involving mid east oil pipeline ni guess world domination just isn a attractive to terrorist a money making venture anymore nbond is brought in to protect the pipeline owner elektra king sophie marceau who is the daughter of one of renard recent victim nalong the way bond ha to enlist the help of nuclear scientist dr christmas jones denise richards and his old rival valentin zukovsky robert carlyle nlike all bond film you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot since it is ridiculous beyond word nmy biggest complaint would be that it wa about the most disjointed of any of the bond film nthere wa at least one point that had to stop and try to remember why bond wa where he wa and why he wa doing what he wa doing nthe buddy that saw the movie with wa completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau character nit wa alluded to earlier in the movie briefly although not included in the film nlater it became big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something nbut because it is bond film the beautiful woman and nifty gadget seem to make you forget about script problem quite quickly nafter all it isn shakespeare nhow about the cast nbrosnan seems to get better with each of his appearance a 007 ni grew up with the roger moore version of bond so really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character njudi dench a had bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearance in the role nshe brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner nrobbie coltrane wa easily one of the best part in goldeneye so it wa nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie ncoltrane get more screen time which simply lead to him stealing even more scene nthen there are the bond girl nsophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actress working today nthere is just something about her breathtaking eye that make her natural to play the innocent victim nthose that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just pretty face nmarceau may be the most talented actress to ever play bond love interest nthen we have denise richards nthere wa no doubt in my mind that she wa cast exclusively for her look nand after you see the outfit she wear you won have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer eye ni wa pleasantly surprised to find that she really did good job playing nuclear scientist nadmittedly there wa one point that the audience snickered bit at one of her technical line of dialogue but other than that she stack up no pun intended to her bond girl predecessor nicely ni must say that the biggest disappointment wa robert carlyle character nwhile carlyle did fine job with the material that he had his character just never worked for me nthe producer tried very hard to add more complexity to his character but it just never quite got off the ground ni guess wa hoping for bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character but the writer decided to play up the emotional side of his character nthis might have worked well in another movie but don go to see bond movie for their deep characterization nlast but not least we have desmond llewelyn a this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn a bond gadget guy and he is a good a ever nalthough his screen time ha grown far more limited in the past few film he is still treat to watch nrumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role nhe say future appearance are up to higher power nthe producer have introduced his protege and future replacement bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese nwhile we don see much of him in this film think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn legacy whenever it is passed on will be in very capable hand nso how doe it stack up ndespite some problem the world is not enough is very entertaining movie nand all thing considered what problem it doe have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movie nthis is easily the best of the brosnan film nit may even be the best of the entire series certainly in the top 3 none thing is for sure even after 19 movie there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series nhere looking forward to bond number 20',\n",

because of those overused moment we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film nbut leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and few surprise to mess with your head none surprise in particular left me smiling just because mamet actually had the gut to add it to his script naction film are dime dozen in hollywood and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining u they lack the one thing which would make them more respected genre intelligence neven horror film have learned this genre which is probably the least respected of them all nthe river wild wa one of the best action suspense film have seen from the 90 nthe intelligence of the screenplay and the suspense drawn from the realistic character is nearly unmatched to this day nthe edge ha the intelligence and smart character but this time the lack of originality is the downfall ni must admit that it wa very suspenseful and had an original third half but the first hour and half is riddled with cliche and plot hole nthis is an example of the final act saving the film instead of the other way around a in the lost world nif only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minute intensity it could have become great action film and use the term loosely nthe edge is pretty much survival of the fittest film nbut taking scream lead the edge make fun of the genre cliche and then us them though not quite a effectively ncharles morse anthony hopkins is the main character rich and very intelligent man who wonder what the accumulation of all this knowledge ha brought to him nfor once we don immediately care for the main character ninstead we like bob alec baldwin photographer who is going to take picture of charles wife mickey elle macpherson out in the wilderness nthey board plane and head to cabin somewhere in the arctic ncharles birthday is the same day and he receives gold watch from his wife and pocket knife from bob na action film go these item do have importance to the rest of the story but quite bit more than we first expect nsoon however bob want to find native to shoot picture of because of his personality ncharles bob bob assistant steve harold perrineau and the pilot head off to find him and a shown in the preview hit flock of bird flying south for the winter ndown the plane go the pilot is killed and the three are left to survive in the wilderness ndirector lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow and therefore ha to create original way to approach the situation nhe succeeds often enough for u to enjoy the film ntake for instance the entire man hunting bear plot nthis ha been done many time in film with different animal and even bear nbut given the charles intelligence and bob uncertainty many of the cliche are given fresh twist neven charles himself seems to have seen these action film before nmy favorite line of the film come from charles most people die in the wilderness because they didn do the one thing that could save their life nthinking ndespite the predictability of the main plot subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise and made me smile when realized that everything isn a it seems anymore ni have to write cautiously a to not reveal this surprise so instead will avoid it entirely nthe first two third of the edge have many humorous moment to push it along and some of charles survival technique seem possible even making fire from ice ntamahori is able to create lot of suspense from the stalking bear but whenever the bear is present the character lose all sensibility ni have always wondered why character in film walk over log to get across water nwhy not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ni guess getting chased by bear make your thought process turn off for while nthankfully we already have begun to care for the character and so we let this small detail slide nbut some of the technical detail are awkward such a the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make where did they get thread and needle nthe acting of the film is highly above average for film of this nature and border on phenomenal nanthony hopkins give terrific performance creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day nhopkins usually brings greatness to his role but here he exceeds at gaining the audience sympathy something he definitely did not do in silence of the lamb nalec baldwin give one of his best performance have ever seen it sure is better from his fair game nbaldwin can be good or bad character and here he

out of recycled part ndavid mamet script though ha lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat and the acting is solid nthe best thing about the script is the ending which doesn end with the normal

his sword ntaran agrees much to eilonwy horror but at least they get the black cauldron nbut the cauldron can be destroyed only it evil power can be stopped nthe only way to do so is for living being to climb into it of his own free will never to return alive nthings take turn for the worse when the horned king henchman capture taran eilonwy and fflewdurr along with the black cauldron and lead them back to the castle ntaran eilonwy and fflewdurr watch in horror a the horned king unleashes the supernatural power of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warrior this is the most horrifying scene in the film because here dead army come alive njust when all seems lost though gurgi reappears and rescue taran eilonwy and fflewdurr ntaran is about to jump into the black cauldron

before the heartbroken group na taran cradle him in his arm though gurgi stir he is not dead after all nthe happy group then return home where hen wen brought home by the fairfolk once the danger are past dallben and even doli await their triumphant return na spectacular a it sound the black cauldron really suffered lot in it past time nbefore ron miller wa fired from his position a chairman of walt disney production he had bought novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron sword and sorcery tale for the studio nbringing this book to the screen wa the studio fondest dream nmiller who entitled himself a the executive producer promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other project nwhen micheal eisner and his executive arrived at the disney animation studio the animator were struggling to complete the black cauldron nby this time thing had gone really rocky for the animation department nmany of the studio old men had retired or died ntherefore the animator suffered hard time making this film noriginally budgeted at 25 million the cost raised to 40 million because of constant change on everything and when it wa finally released on june 24 1985 the black cauldron wa greeted by praising review from some critic but somehow the film flopped nthe film wa rated pg and the film although disneyfied from lloyd alexander chronicle of prydain which is what this film is based on wa much more scarier and darker than disney other previous effort such a the rescuer and the fox and the hound which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it nin addition other critic rejected it for having no heart and unmemorable compared to other disney animated feature nbut whatever the real reason the black cauldron wa financial disaster grossing only 21 million nthe failure of the film grounded the studio animation department and exiled the animation team to annex building in nearby glendale and it seemed like animated feature would no longer become part of the studio reputation nthe next two disney animated feature the great mouse detective and oliver and company although little more lighthearted than the black cauldron didn do much better although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective nonly with the little mermaid did the studio regain it reputation for successful animated feature na for the black cauldron it wa rereleased in some city for temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron nfinally the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even wa released nbecause of all this you might ask yourself wa the black cauldron really such bad movie nthe people who had seen the film didn think so nin fact many people had call to buena vista home video requesting for the film but of course they denied it nfor while it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video until september 1997 disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom nfew people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc including me and for those who hadn seen the film yet am included here they got quite treat nbut people who had bootleg copy of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raise his army of deathless warrior about 12 second of ghoulish looking skeleton were slightly trimmed so that the film would get u rating in the uk the rating mean universal suitable for all age kinda like their own version of nsomewhere online team of diehard the black cauldron fan signed petition that said bring back the black cauldron and because of that disney finally decided to release the video to the united state nbefore that time rumor online had been made that the video would be trimmed like the uk video so that it would get g rating and that they would add in song nthose rumor were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron would be released in it pg rated version neven still when it wa finally released to the u some reaction wa mixed nsome felt that it wa indeed cut but some felt that it wasn nbut these where only minor criticism which seemed laughable since film that wa absent for thirteen year wa finally available na for myself when saw the movie for the first time on converted ntsc video didn expect much at all nin fact had heard so many mediocre thing about it that didn think the film would ever be such good film nmuch to my surprise when saw the first few minute of the film wa asking myself this is the same film everyone saw nthe one that flopped at the box office nthe one that critic and filmgoers alike called bad movie nthis doesn seem like all of the above ninstead it a classic in it own right nthe film ha wonderful cast of character nthere taran grant bardsley an assistant pig keeper who would rather be warrior than pig keeper the story hero nthe critic have said that taran is not likeable at all but the opposite is true nhe is brave loyal and eventually learns lesson about friendship later on nthere a likeable character here nnot that he the only likeable character in the film nthere gurgi john biner lovable little uh thing who remains loyal to taran even though they don quite hit it off at first nbut another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman dwarf named creeper phil fondacairo who is loyal to the film imaginative and sinister villain the horned king voiced gruesomely by john hurt yet he also fear his neck nthe other character including the sidekick spunky but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm and three comically wicked witch who hide dark secret although pleasant and likeable aren quite a well rounded a they should be nthe story itself is an adventurous one quest involving the mystical pig hen wen the black cauldron itself and an army of deathless one with everything hooking opening to spectacular finale nelmer bernstein music also tell the story perfectly in dark yet calming manner nthe animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film wa created in the darkest time of the studio neven though there are some occasional effect that are not quite good like the ground opening when the black cauldron rise out of the earth the animation overall is top notch noverall this film is an entertaining endeavor nfans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicle of prydain will get kick out of this one except young kid nthere are some extremely scary scene which are more darker than disney other film although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fire of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just a scary which is the main reason why this film is rated pg nfans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the difference between the novel and the movie neven though it doesn have all of the ingredient of true disney film this film is classic in it own right and deserves far better chance than what it ha been given nthat better chance ha finally come nwhatever reason about why the black cauldron wa such big failure seems to have disappeared and the film ha finally achieved it place among disney most proudest achievement ni can help but think though whatever would have happened if the black cauldron wa box office

home to his parent during the war are on display at harvard and were evidently the inspiration for glory na the film begin in 1862 shaw is captain in the northern force nlike private eriksson michael

mass slaughter and receiving minor wound himself when bullet graz his neck nsoon after his recovery shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train black in the war effort nglory is the story not only of colonel shaw but also of the black soldier who laid down their life to free their brother from slavery nthe film periodically jump between shaw point of view and the perspective of the black soldier nthe movie introduces u to handful of black recruit and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action nthe large black cast is uniformly outstanding especially washington who is electrifying a runaway slave with big mouth nhe is brash and pushy always getting into trouble and always looking for fight nhis bitter tough guy facade is really just mask for his loneliness and vulnerability nwashington provides much of the film intensity and emotional power nin one heartbreaking scene he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army nwhen he remove his shirt to receive the punishment you cringe at the sight of his back which is riddled with ugly scar from his day a slave nit make your blood boil nthe humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings tear roll down washington cheek and will probably run down your cheek a well nthe episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn deserting the army at all he left camp to look for shoe because his foot were covered with oozing sore nfreeman is a usual strong presence even in small supporting role nhe play grave digger who ha buried more white soldier than he care to remember nhe quickly becomes leader among the black soldier holding the group together and serving a liaison to the white officer ncolonel shaw

black who is one of shaw close childhood friend nsearles is educated and refined like white man prompting washington to nickname him snow flake nthe burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat nthe road from marching drill to battle action is bumpy one for the black regiment nthe soldier suffer innumerable hardship but somehow they never lose their morale nthe army treat the black soldier like second class citizen subjecting them to racism and discrimination nthey are paid only 10 month whereas their white counterpart earn thirteen and for long time they have to go without shoe gun or uniform nto make matter worse the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the black into action preferring instead to use them for manual labor neventually however the regiment receives it boot uniform rifle and right to fight thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw nshaw ha absolute faith in his soldier and he fight tooth and nail to get them what they deserve even if it mean threatening general with blackmail nbroderick in fact is most convincing in the scene where shaw stand up for the regiment nunfortunately however broderick uneven performance is in many respect the weak link in the movie nin an effort to look more mature broderick sport mustache and goatee and throughout the film he slip in and out of phony

not to say that the battle scene in glory are timid nto the contrary they are chaotic and horrifying it just that director edward zwick the co creator of thirtysomething film them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster nthe key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldier nthe movie depicts some of but not enough of their custom and ritual nin one scene for example the soldier motivate themselves by singing prayer around the campfire neach man ha chance to relay few word of inspiration na couple of the movie most touching moment involve young black child looking up to the black soldier with awe disbelief and pride nthe regiment greatest triumph come when the soldier distinguish themselves in battle thereby earning the respect of their white peer and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner nlike any war film glory ha it share of gloom and despair but ultimately it prof to be truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson valuable reminder that despite what the history book say or more precisely what they do not say black played critically important role in the north victory over the south

       " 'seen may 31 1999 on home video rented none of the best thing about the movie is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze thing in your own everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise nwith some film it might be just secondary issue but with dark city what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are which is poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in movie nthere an old role playing computer game called ja wherein the player take on the role of man who can remember who he is where he is and how he got there nthe goal is to gather a many clue a possible to figure that out and along the way overcome conflict nthe premise to this film is not unlike that game only this time we don have control over the protagonist nwe begin by meeting seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city actually it more than just the city it the whole reality that isn just that neo gothic look la batman blade runner but is so fully developed it almost different genre completely nlater he will learn that his name is john murdoch sewell but for now he ha no idea what going on other than the fact something is not right nthe fact there a dead body in the corner go to enhance the feeling of paranoia and mysterious hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling nthis opening scene alone go long way to define the setting of the film and it bizarre horrific tone nthe man doesn know who he is nor where he going and it interesting to follow him since we the viewer have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him nin fact this is the way all story begin since it impossible to know the history of character their feeling value moral etc until after we ve observed them for while nbut in this case the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization developing the mood and outlining the story neventually some semblance of plot begin to unfold a it appears that john is serial killer wanted by the police nwe met inspector frank bumstead hurt quiet unemotional soft spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time ntwo other important character are also introduced dr daniel schreber sutherland neurotic psychiatrist who claim to be john doctor and emma murdoch connelly jazz singer dolled up to look like caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serial or any given leading lady of the old film noir movie nit wa schreber who contacted john for reason that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film nhe also contact emma which further help the film reveal what is seemingly complex mysterious back story nbut absolutely nothing is a it appears to be in dark city which is what make it so fascinating throughout it continual scene of confusion and vertigo neverything the filmmaker want u to see ha some significance considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot it lighting art direction and overall production design they don seem to be able to afford any gratuity nhowever that might also be what keeping it from reaching it maximum potential nby continuing to follow john a he wanders around this strange place so much unlike the real world we know we come to realize that it all hoax neveryone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by race of alien to understand what make human tick in their effort to somehow save themselves from extinction nbut a the film tagline say last night one of u went off nfor reason that are never clearly explained it appears that john posse telekinetic power to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive process known a tuning nthe alien which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin also posse the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight nat the same time all the human fall asleep and after the change are made they awake and either continue where they left off or begin new life they have no idea they did not have until then nthis premise certainly is interesting and director and co screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard nhe doe provide some explanation such a that dr schreber is an assistant to the stranger because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form nthe alien mix and match the memory of the city population to see who will change and who will not nin the process this creates for good deal of deep thought provoking philosophy that could be applied to the real world nhowever where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart a to what make person who he or she is nthe main character are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotion it come off a distant static and cold mediocre performance by hurt and connelly don help either nfor example john realizes emma is not and probably never wa his wife so he doe not feel an emotional bond to her yet in some scene crucial to the film plot we are expected to believe they do have genuine love for each other which is also part of the film climax and ending nand that what proyas seems to be inferring with the film but never quite manages to convey in it fullest sense nironically this is what made his first film the crow work so well which had similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within nearly identical dark twisted world nwith dark city the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message nstill the film is by no mean bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable nthere a lot to like here most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which account for at least half the reason the film is able to tell the story it doe nthe story a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in year dark city is what the movie are all about the escape from the real world',\n",

rip offs followed in the year thereafter nthat fad seems to be over but here come christopher mcquarrie writing and directing the way of the gun that at first glance look like another of those wanna be but upon closer inspection doesn look like anything comprehendable nit a crime story so wrapped up in it own little world it ha claustrophobic atmosphere film that won allow the story much room to expand outside it handful of character and somehow still manages to turn simple premise into something so complex it ridiculous ncomplexity should come a no surprise to anyone who familiar with mcquarrie he wrote the usual suspect which ha become cult favorite despite little critical acclaim nthat film had great story and wa well directed but had such an elaborate confusing screenplay it leaf many viewer scratching their head after repeated viewing nyou have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he wa going for the hollywood idea that if it really confusing and about criminal and cop that make it fascinating nwith the way of the gun mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea but this time the story is far le commercial shame because maybe that would have helped nthe film tell the story of two drifter with no ambition and barely reason to live but aren hell bent on death either played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro nthey get lucky when they hear about scheme between big shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have baby through in vitro fertilization nthey figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother played by juliette lewis and get nice ransom nalong the way we continually learn of the shady dealing between the exec his wife their hired goon and the bag man played by james caan the only actor in the film who look like he know what he doing nthe exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can call the authority for help nhis goon and the bag man are on the kidnapper trail and each make different offer to get the mother back nthe exec son is doctor who also get pulled into the fray and want to make sure his patient is all right nmeanwhile each of these character ha something hidden up their collective sleeve and the double cross secret love affair and torrid past come a no surprise even though little of it ha any relevance at all nmcquarrie doesn know the meaning of the word simple nhe seems to be more interested in showing u how clever he is than making good movie neverything ha to be complicated and confusing so much so that it to the point of surrealism nnothing is what it seems in this reality it one of those movie where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry rule and regulation nevery scene with caan character exemplifies this perfectly the kidnapper already know who he is and even chat with him getting into conversation about the business and how it work and we re hardly given clue a to what they re talking about nthese character are probably supposed to be great criminal sketch but they re more like idea ripped off from sketch found in david mamet trash nno one here really act like real person and the story is even further removed from reality nit like dream without any appeal ntake the opening scene for example the phillipe and del toro character are in parking lot across the street from bar or club counting their money and stuff nthey sit on brand new mercedes and the car alarm go off the owner is waiting in line and yell at them to get away from his car but they don move nthe guy and his loud mouth potty mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them nyou think phillipe and del toro are going to pull out gun and scare them away but they don instead phillipe throw one punch and the two get beat down by mob nthere a lot of thing didn understand about this scene first of all the owner of the mercedes isn some yuppie or old rich snob he like hippie straight out of the 60 nsecondly the two main character seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed nlastly it serf no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than small country army nif they were suicidal they wouldn have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place and where they get all those gun is never explained either nthere a lot more could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility nwhat it all come down to is that nothing here is what it seems which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is nabsolutely none of the character are likable or believable nand it all coated with thin layer of black comedy which is good for chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not flat out black comedy and it use of such seems like desperate attempt to kill screen time nwith any film you see whether you like it or not you can at least understand what the appeal wa to it why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it ni can say either for the way of the gun because it ha very little going for it and can imagine anyone intelligently defending it',\n",

you like seeing bad movie nso do nso saw supernova ntruth be told supernova wasn quite a bad a thought it might be nmaybe just felt sorry for the actor or maybe thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn started tinkering with the director walter hill final cut causing him to want his name removed nmaybe m becoming softy nin any case didn find supernova a bad a the advance buzz would have me believe nbut it still bad nthe film take place aboard the medical space vessel nightingale nthe crew includes captain j nmarley robert forster his new second officer nick vanzant james spader head medical officer kaela evers angela bassett medical technician yerzy penalosa lou diamond phillips and danika lund robin tunney and computer technician benj sotomejor wilson cruz nthere are some attempt at characterization but all that mean is that nick ha shady past involving drug addiction which put kaela on edge yerzy and danika have relationship that requires them to make kissy face at each other every five minute and benj apparently gay is in love with the computer apparently female ndon expect any more explanation because you won get it nanyway the crew get distress call from location deep in space to which failed mining operation had been sent nduring the dimension jump think that what it called but don hold me to it the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal peter facinelli is brought on board nhe call himself troy larson making him the supposed son of man kaela once had relationship with nthen bunch of really predictable stuff start happening nhave you seen alien nhave you seen event horizon lame movie in it own right ngood nthen you ve seen supernova npost production cut or not there is nothing original about this screenplay and nothing unpredictable either nafter all no one going to think for second that troy won turn out to be villain nbut the bigger problem with supernova is that it can just stick to the simple plot it afforded nnumerous re writes the script may be credited to three people but it a gross underestimate have crammed this lean 90 minute film with ton of extraneous plot thread that all remain underdeveloped nwas there something about limping robot shaped like fighter pilot ndid the ship computer learn something about humanity nwhat wa that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him nand just what doe the film title signify if anything na far a can tell it refers to very small plot detail that isn developed just like the rest of these unnecessary story element ncharacter relationship in this film also make very little sense nfor some reason every person in this film keep having sex nwe get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minute nbassett and spader character start off hating each other nfifteen minute and one bottle of pear brandy later they re engaging in some hanky panky nwhen troy the creepy stranger show up on the ship of course both female crew member will fall in love with him nevery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly which is only one of the many obvious clue to how much this film ha been cut nthe most prominent example however may be the fact that when the film start there are no opening credit nfurthermore the end of the film look like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credit and spliced them in right before the real end credit nmaybe that why the film title is mentioned twice during the end credit right between james spader and robert forster nright after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you re seeing lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of scene with little to no introduction to any of the character or situation nthe rest of the movie feel like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character change you know where they explain thing and just went from point to point point danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby npoint tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing ndoesn make sense nsince didn understand anything about these character motivation did care when troy abruptly start murdering them one by one and he doe knocking off three of them in about 10 minute nnot whit nit a shame because this cast contains lot of talented actor looking for something to do nthey don find it nbassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expression on their face nsexual tension nmore like constipation nmaybe they re just embarrassed at having to utter such howler a this thing wa made by someone more powerful than god and whole lot le nice nnot that we ever find out who that is mind you nthe climax of their relationship taking place in transport pod is probably the film biggest forehead slapper na troy peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected nhe awfully one note but it not a if he given any more note to work with nthe rest of the cast doe even le ntunney stand around looking cute then scared nphillips brood ncruz flirt with the computer nthen they all die and star blow up or something but really wasn paying much attention by then supernova is pretty awful but m cutting it little slack merely because expected le than what got nthat it nif you expect it to be good for whatever reason you may have you ll probably hate it more than will neven the special effect are fairly unimpressive nothing you haven seen before and suffice to say the script isn going to save the film nhonestly though what do you expect from film with about dozen writer and director who

today even after the end of the cold war fail safe usa 1964 drama 111 minute nscreenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max youngstein directed by sidney lumet nreview by jamahl epsicokhan nthe most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn have winning side and losing side nin nuclear confrontation everybody loses and the aftereffect have devastating effect that impact the entire world assuming the world survives nthe idea and perhaps the only real option is to avoid war at all cost nthis is the theme of sidney lumet fail safe fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler fail safe take place during the heart of the cold war the actual film wa released two year after the cuban missile crisis when the united state and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in single word communism nthe premise center around combination of accident and operation flaw nfive s bomber carrying nuclear warhead are ordered to set routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america nthe unidentified aircraft turn out to be commercial airliner but mechanical failure strike the military base that command the bomber nsuddenly out of contact and with standing order to remain on course until receiving new directive the bomber pilot cannot be recalled and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with nuclear strike na great deal of fail safe plot follows various character a they attempt to devise way of stopping the s bomber from reaching russia border at any cost nthe plot is compelling and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenario nthe reality set in quickly a one attempt to turn the bomber after another fails ngeneral bogan frank overton taking order directly from the president of the united state himself henry fonda is powerless the fate of the world lie in the hand of an automated pre programmed system that may not be stoppable simply because the creator of the war machine were too efficient in their task to make no win situation winnable nthe event in fail safe are fascinating because they re anything but predictable but the real reason fail safe work is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of it plot na key ingredient to the film is it ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war communism the cold war and the united state role in all of it nmost of this is through the film use of the character groeteschele walter matthau an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapon use who incidentally is on the president advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging nuclear war nmany of the film most pointed message arise from discussion where groeteschele is one of the key voice nearly in the film he host dinner party where he explains the importance of strategy in nuclear assault to minimize casualty what the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead na guest asks impatiently forty million groeteschele responds wryly nthe problem with groeteschele mindset is that he belief nuclear combat to be viable method of war nthe only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty total ngroeteschele realizes that these weapon can destroy the world several time over nyet his answer to the arm race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off a general black dan herlihy ha often recommended non the contrary according to groeteschele that would lead to russia having more nuclear weapon than the s which would clearly put america at disadvantage nsuch stance wa perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arm race fail safe clearly see it a one of the central issue of the cold war and likewise it becomes central theme in the film nwhy continue to build such machine of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several time over ni it wise ni it even logical nno not really nalthough fail safe is more about the issue of nuclear weapon than it is about the political ramification of communism there is scene in the film that deal with communism in an intentionally superficial one sided sort of way nagain this is achieved through groeteschele who is easily the film most important character in term of the larger theme significance nin addition to providing the central pro nuclear war voice that the film warns against he also make key remark about communist that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism nthe context the film us suggests that this hatred wa often glib none of groeteschele logical train of thought venture so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it merely absurd nhe label the average marxist an unfeeling calculating machine that will do whatever it take to preserve itself ngroeteschele take it so far a to say that if the s drop the warhead on moscow the soviet will instantly surrender for to retaliate would invite counter measure that would further destroy russia home soil which must be preserved at all cost ngroeteschele seems to forget these people are human being with emotion general black quickly reminds him that the soviet would attack out of revenge a any normal person would nthe irony here is groeteschele own mechanical theorizing nhe is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn even realize his own seemingly programmed thought pattern nonce the film make it evident that turning the s bomber will be impossible the question becomes what the consequence of destroying moscow will be njust how will the soviet union leader react and what can the president do to convey his best intention just how doe one pas off the death of million of people a an mishap nwith the help of his translator buck larry hagman the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader in scene that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity with lumet long take of fonda and hagman in the same frame exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader nwithout getting into too much detail will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly yet necessary and a sensible a possible under the circumstance that is a sensible a nuclear incident can probably be nit doe accomplish what it must it avoids an all out war something that simply isn possible because of it all too real consequence ndramatically the ending is quite powerful and the use of herlihy character a the symbolic matador providing bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film opening is particularly appropriate fail safe is production of major hollywood studio released by columbia picture and it ha the structure of high tension suspense thriller that one might expect from hollywood film nnevertheless under lumet direction and walter bernstein intelligent adaptation of burdick and wheeler novel the film continues to have lasting effect even after the event on screen have unfolded nthe film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming nbut it wa the conscious human choice to initialize this automatic arming that fail safe also find dangerous nin retrospect the arm race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercise in futility of the century nit just fortunate that both side were finally able to come to their sens and slow down rather than continuing groeteschele dangerous approach of speeding up and causing possible meltdown',\n",

must have come a easy to him a nuclear physic doe to kindergartner ndoes this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash though nthe answer to that question is not very easy one either na far a pacing go the sixth sense seemed almost interminable nit wasn until the surprise ending wa revealed that realized the film wa actually intentionally and perfectly paced in order to give the audience ample time to re connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached nfor unbreakable shyamalan gave the film much more satisfying pace which in many way blow away the film that had come before nthe story move along at steady pace and shyamalan direction is excellent with the camera almost constantly moving nthere are ton of great shot in the film not least of which is conversation that open the film between willis character and another train passenger nthe shot seems a though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seat and the camera steadily glide back and forth between the two actor a they speak nalso very impressive is the film score by james newton howard who also scored shyamalan sixth sense and the similar film stir of echo a well a this year dinosaur nseveral of the scene are driven by very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film none of the best example of this is scene in which dunne go into train station to exercise his power nthe music in combination with the stellar visuals really go long way towards making this an incredible movie nif there wa any one soundtrack would make must

intense hurt of her character need for love from her husband and her desire to make thing work again nspencer treat clark a the dunne young son jeremy show that shyamalan still ha knack for picking young actor and he turn in one of the most competent performance in the film nout of all the character jeremy is perhaps the most emotional and clark doe great job with the role nwhere the film doe lose point though is during it surprise ending nshyamalan ha said in interview that he wa going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense but found myself saying that wa it nwhen unbreakable revealed it own ending nit not that the ending is bad it just that the ending doesn quite have the emotional punch that the other film did nplus it almost seems like it set itself up for sequel and won reveal the ending here but you ll understand what mean when you see it nessentially what all of this mean is that shyamalan ha made another good film with unbreakable nthe only real problem is that the ending doesn quite fill the shadow left by it predecessor na long a it isn held to the standard that sixth sense set which it ultimately will be it should be remarkably well liked

tough but something we all have to accomplish nsecondly and along the same line we can prejudge film because of it star director etc the difference nwell in the first one we go into film thinking it going to be dumb or it going to be good and that would affect our viewing that movie sound and look dumb so m not expecting much non the second hand we re simply assuming it will be bad or good because of personal grudge against the film company it made by disney noh it just merchandising ploy then the actor jim carrey in it nit gonna stink or the director who ncan be that good nthis is more of biased viewpoint a opposed to first impression viewpoint nmake sense nok but what about comparing nisn that kind of along the same line nwhen we compare certain actor or director or even composer credibility in one film to another they were involved in is that really fair nsure in sequel you can expect and accept comparison lot more but what about jackie brown for example ni it fair for me to take the review and turn it into comparison of pulp fiction just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ni think it is and ll tell you why na good critic should be able to view the film from the average joe or jane viewpoint while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film nsometimes that can be tough the acting wa superb but wa bored or loved it nit wa sooooo cheezy nmight be used to describe film nthese are contradiction and critic ha to weigh both side and come to suitable balanced critique nbut which is more important nand which is better nan extremely well shot and acted film that is boring or really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ngetting back to the point my philosophy on comparing film being fair work because we re reflecting what the public want to know anyway nevery average person out there who interested in this film is likely to ask how doe it compare to pulp fiction nand so a critic m already responsible to ask that same question njackie brown star pam grier the blaxploitation heroine from the 1970 who is likely to make big comeback thanks to her role a the title character ntarantino pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta sudden revival in the movie industry and with talk of an oscar nomination the same is likely to happen for grier we ve made it thru comparison 1 jackie is 44 year old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash and probably her main revenue by smuggling large sum of money into the united state for ordell robbie pulp fiction samuel jackson and comparison 2 nordell is in the illegal firearm business and ha enlisted the aid of louis gara robert de niro bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four year to help him accomplish scheme worth half million dollar ntrouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton and taken into custody for possession of narcotic a well a having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed nnaturally this prof an obstacle to ordell plan and not a friendly intended a we hope he post jackie bail after she is put behind bar nthe thing is ordell is in this for no one more than himself and a we learn from his previous action he willing to kill anyone who stand in the way njackie find herself in tight squeeze nordell won think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him a she always done yet at the same time compromise with the authority would be in order if evidence against ordell wa provided nit come down to simple question would jackie rather face ordell or prison nwhat ensues is rich and intriguing example of storytelling a we question who jackie is really out to help the law ordell or maybe just herself ncoming into play is another 70 veteran robert forster a jackie bail bondsman max cherry nmax obvious fondness for jackie will become major benefactor in her fight to beat both side of the system and forster play him with subtle charm that add depth to unbrewed romance nalso involved is ordell surfer girl girlfriend melanie bridget fonda ditzy sun bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with bong in hand nfonda doe the best she can with an essentially thin role but there nothing more to her and therefore she becomes tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of character nde niro is also wasted in his role a quiet nobody crook out to score few buck for himself nde niro is brilliant actor but character who hardly ever speaks doesn need de niro to play him ncompared to pulp fiction comparison 3 the character in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable nin pulp fiction even the small seemingly irrelevant character were wonderful complete and lifelike whereas jackie brown ha such common figure that it wouldn have suffered much with lesser talented cast the exception being grier ntarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind so to say that she is made for this role is reversed truth nsadly grier too could have received bit more attention especially when the story is all about her newly jarred perception of life njackson team up with tarantino again but the chemical reaction isn a awesome a the first time njules wa the rambling bible quoting hitman in pulp fiction and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off nand although jackson is really really good in jackie brown don think he quite a irreplaceable nin fact maybe new face would have been better njackson could ve remained tarantino jules and new guy could have become ordell forever to remain so in our memory nsadly these character are too much the same except ordell just isn a impressive and putting this in the hand of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollection of jules nanother problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning nthis is grier film so why spend so long getting to know man who will become more of supporting character a the film progress nit not only make the movie feel little too slanted but it make for slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story nit is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style and not so much those interested in seeing silver screen adaption of elmore leonard novel rum punch nfor those movie goer don expect another pulp fiction and you ll be satisfied for the script ooze with the familiar brash quality that ha made tarantino an icon of 90 film making nthe directing ha toned down bit however yet we re still reminded that this is tarantino movie thanks to odd split screen story telling device and scene being replayed multiple time from different viewpoint nso getting back to the question that began with this isn pulp fiction at all nit good but it isn anything that made pulp fiction such revolutionary effort in the first place nthis is more conservative tarantino but not one that won satiate true fan nif you can realize that this isn going to knock your sock off then you ll be happy to at least let it massage your foot nafter all we all know how much tarantino love that particular part of the human anatomy',\n",

went into production nbut where rocky romanticizes boxing raging bull take cold unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring nwhile scorsese primary aim is to present riveting deconstruction of la motta the man he never back away from showing the seedy ugly underside of sport where gambling greed and organized crime force fighter to throw match to continue working nrocky show boxing at it noblest raging bull show it at it most diseased nthere little can say here that hasn already said about de niro performance nin career that ha included many fine role this is his most outstanding nthe level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering nand although there a lot of travis bickle de niro character in taxi driver in la motta scorsese and de niro go to great length to make sure that if we never fully sympathize with him at least we understand the force that drive him nthis is complete characterization and perfect example of acting na the younger jake de niro is trim and fit na the fat older man de niro gained 50 pound and turned his body into grotesque parody of it normal form nhow many actor would go that far nthe best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance ncathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nomination for their supporting work although neither won ntheir portrayal have the same raw energy that infuses de niro npesci who ha basically re created the same personality in two other scorsese film goodfellas and casino present joey a slightly more intelligent version of his brother nthe misogyny and violence are still there only better concealed nbut when joey snap a he doe in one scene where he pound on mobster frank vincent it startling to behold nmoriarty on the other hand must play the temptress with virginal quality the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake nlater she called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love ha turned into fear nscorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black and white few home movie segment are in color nthe choice is perfect for the movie giving raging bull unique look in an era when black and white approach is almost unheard of one important recent exception schindler list eschewed color for some of the same reason that raging bull did nin black and white especially considering scorsese choice of shot and use of slow motion the violence is stark and disturbing nthere no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas nduring fight sequence the director also us number of point of view shot designed to show the world however briefly from la motta perspective nscorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta loss to sugar ray where he surrendered his middleweight crown nafter that his career wa all downhill nyet the director allows the film to run for thirty minute after this pivotal moment stretching more than decade into la motta future nthe reason is obvious scorsese isn a interested in boxing a he is in the character nfollowing his retirement la motta is still a violent and volatile a ever but he ha lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendency nwe see the result of this beast let loose on society and how the consequence of his action reduce him to parody of his former self nwho cannot feel surge of pity for la motta a he quietly recites marlon brando speech from on the waterfront i coulda been contenda nperhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the 80 nand if not it certainly perilously close to the zenith',\n",

aardman animation produced three oscar winning short film creature comfort the wrong trouser and close shave nthe latter two were the second and third installment of trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventure npart of what made the wallace film brilliantly entertaining wa park uncanny ability to make an old story seem new the wrong trouser for example pulled out lot of old hitchcockian suspense trick and close shave owed great deal of inspiration to classic detective story nbut in the hand of park and his team the story felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived nnow teaming with co director peter lord park ha created similar creature in chicken run nthe plot is largely lifted from the great escape watch for quick reference to the ball bouncing scene with some spielberg inspired action sequence providing the excitement nthing is the film doesn feel like it been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feel fresh alive like nothing else ever done npart of it is the original idea who in the world came up with the idea to make prisoner of war movie starring chicken npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it worth the character treat their situation a if it were dead serious and to them it is nbut they re chicken so it funny to u nanother thing that help chicken run and most of park film succeed is the animator subtle way of giving nod to the very film they re cribbing nthere are reference to the great escape obviously and stalag 17 nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parody both raider of the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple of doom nthere even nod to the blue brother if you can believe it and the filmmaker even get in little light hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor taking couple of very subtle jab at mel gibson nationality and film history nthe braveheart reference is hoot if you catch it nwhen you consider just how fine line resides between funny parody and redundant one chicken run is downright brilliant in it execution nconsider this since july of last year ve seen dozen upon dozen of blair witch project parody on television on the radio and online nout of all those maybe one or two were amusing the rest tiresome nwhy nbecause once you got past the thought that they re parodying that 8216 blair witch movie most of the parody had nothing to offer no insight no original idea no greater purpose nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing nconversely chicken run doesn lean on it parody the film reference are never the sole focus of any scene nif you ve never seen indiana jones the chase sequence is still fun neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is rocky remains an interesting character npark lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience doe not need parody shoved in their face before it understood and a result chicken run is filled with visual and verbal jab that are never too obvious but not quite vague either nenjoyment of this movie doesn require knowledge of film history but if you ve got it chicken run is that much richer nthe voice cast turn in uniformly lively performance and the character they play are given so many subtle nuance that it hard not to fall in love with every one of them nginger is perfect spunky and opinionated but with soft heart that forbids her to leave her companion behind and julia sawalha known a the cute mousy girl on absolutely fabulous nail it nshe ha warm human chemistry with gibson whose rocky hide his personal doubt under brash gung ho veneer nthe character inevitable romance doesn feel contrived but sweet npoor mr tweedy tony haygarth suspect the chicken are organizing in some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring thing out and his overbearing wife certainly isn any help njane horrocks delivers lovely voice characterization a tragically optimistic babs hen that run away with most of the best one liner all while perpetually crocheting sweater and two supply trading rat that seem to have walked straight out of monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing dancing sequence nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that baffled scholar and theologian alike for decade the chicken v egg dilemma none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off a wearisome but a with most of chicken run it come a delightful surprise nthe film manages to cross all barrier it should be accessible to both child and adult brit and yank rat and chicken nthe animation is first rate nremember that this wa all done the old fashioned way with actual human moving clay figurine around on tiny set bit by painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really is nthis movie posse that same quality that make pixar studio animation great precise and unwavering attention to detail na in such top notch family fare a bug life or toy story 2 chicken run ha something to offer in nearly every frame ncertainly passive viewer can enjoy it a straightforward story with worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scene but active attentive viewer will enjoy it even more because they ll catch all the detail nanyway the movie just boatload of fun nfunnest damn movie ve seen all year',\n",

wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer wa penned by him ntarantino contributed on and off screen to these film but never took the director helm nnearly four year since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta star once more tarantino return with film he can call his own nthe film open up with an homage to the graduate with jackie brown pam grier on one of those airport people mover a the credit are displayed in front of her njackie is flight attendant for air cabo which fly back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas nthis make jackie convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi samuel jackson who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico nhowever while bringing fifty thousand dollar back into the s for ordell jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus michael bowen and atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton who catch her not only with the money but with bonus of couple of ounce of illicit drug njackie didn know they were in the package with the cash but that of no consequence to the authority who threaten jackie with couple of year hard time if convicted nof course dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish ordell nordell us honest bail bondsman max cherry robert forster to get jackie out of jail but while max is immediately attracted to her jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety since ordell killed the last one of his operative who got picked up by the police nsure enough ordell show up at jackie apartment that evening and try to silence jackie for good but she borrows max pistol and manages to turn the table on ordell ninstead of closing the irony circle and relocating bullet from the pistol chamber to ordell head jackie proposes deal nsince ordell want to get his money out of mexico jackie will get back up to her old trick and be courier for him once more but this time for more substantial fee fifteen percent of ordell half million dollar nwith gun in his face how can ordell not agree nby itself this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film nhowever we are also introduced to number of double cross which make u pay attention and think njackie claim to be bringing the money in for ordell but she also making deal with the fed a well a with max nthe film throw u off every once in while by leading u to believe the deal we thought wa authentic is actually sham but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around ninstead it actually nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today movie nat least this film ha little imagination nmost of the performance in jackie brown are above par npam grier of whom had never taken notice before play jackie with mix of confidence and vulnerability which make her character believable nsamuel jackson ha kind of mesmerizing quality about him a he handle himself in situation where you know he is in total control nrobert forster is thoroughly likable because he come across a such an honest guy trying to do his best nnever mind that he belongs to profession where sneaking into guy apartment to zap him with stun gun is simply matter of course nhe just so down to earth the nature of his job really doesn occur to u even when we re shown him bringing handcuffed woman to prison or when we see the tool of his trade nin supporting role are robert de niro a louis gara recently paroled friend of ordell and bridget fonda a melanie one of the girl ordell keep around town nunfortunately de niro is basically wasted a his line are few and far between and then they are mostly clipped sentence nin this film he not really de niro but stereotypical de niro uttering thing like little bit and pretty much nfonda on the other hand play the slightly spaced out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness such that even when she is annoying louis we are taking her side na is characteristic of any film in which tarantino ha had hand the dialog is quick and snappy nit grab our attention and is actually interesting and in many respect this make jackie brown film which need few visuals the line are form of art in and amongst themselves ndon count tarantino out when it come to using the camera however nthere a scene where max is unwittingly watching dry run of money exchange and he not really sure what happening but by composing the scene just so his realization of what going on is felt simultaneously by the audience nwe look at the screen and think gee that clever and then think the same thing about how the film induced u into that wonderful feeling of catching on nalthough tarantino isn afraid to drag out shot for dramatic effect it unfortunately work to varying degree in this film nthere are shot where character is simply driving and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head nthis is tribute to both direction and acting nhowever there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through mall and she is looking for something desperately looking for something nwe get the idea of the frantic nature of her search but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she looking for but instead hoping she ll just stop noverall viewing jackie brown is time spent well nsome flap ha already been made about the language used in the film but it really not much worse than many of the other movie out there today nin fact one might even be able to say that the way in which these offensive word are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness ngo see the film and see what mean',\n",

       " 'people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprise due to the improper labelling of novel story comic book or movie noften science fiction aficionado find material previously labelled a science fiction to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror or rather simple techno thriller nin such case mistake are understandable genre boundary are never clearly marked nbut believe there are really few case when movie labelled a science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic nsuch thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen year ago when national distributor gave such treatment to the right stuff 1983 film directed by philip kaufman nthe mistake of the distributor could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film feature men in space suit nbut the right stuff film isn even fiction nit wa based on the non fiction book by tom wolfe covering the early year of american space program nthe plot of the film begin in 1947 when few people heard of edward air force base major test site for experimental plane nthe major aim of test flight is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier nmany pilot tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their life for such bravado nbut one quiet pilot chuck eager played by sam shaped succeeds and thus give example for whole new generation of test pilot determined to enter history book by breaking new speed record nten year later soviet have launched sputnik marking the beginning of the space age nin order to regain national prestige u government decides to be the first to send man into space nbest air force navy and marine pilot are recruited into program but not yeager because he lack college education and desired all american image nin one of critic poll the right stuff wa named a one among top 10 film made in 1980s nsuch high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman film look quite atypical for it time nwith more than three hour of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s age when hollywood used to make film larger than life nbut the real reason lie in the fact that it wa made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker nphilip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunity of that golden age in order to create original memorable movie nthe right stuff wa the last of them swan song of an era when producer allowed director to spend big buck on unusual risk taking artsy project nthe right stuff is unusual because it lack many standard element of hollywood film nthe plot is almost non existent and not very coherent the story featuring many interesting incident and anecdote shift focus from the old generation of test pilot embodied in yeager to new generation of the astronaut nthe film also lack conventional protagonist yeager who also appears in small cameo remains the true hero of the film but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronaut and their wife making this movie into ensemble piece nthat gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talent until that specialised only for bit or character role nsam shepard is great a yeager war hero whose greatest achievement breech of the sound barrier remained obscured in history book probably due to his own modesty non the surface he lack personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleague but shepard give texture to this character with subtle gesture and phrase nshepard performance is followed with great acting by ed harris a clean cut marine and future politician john glenn nyoung dennis quaid is more than fine a arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom superbly played by fred ward nalways reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief a navy aviator and arguably first american man in space alan shepard nkaufman left room for female talent to excel too barbara hershey pamela reed veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great a pilot wife nroyal dano is also impressive a menacing figure of preacher but the most memorable performance belong to donald moffat a vice president lyndon johnson and jane dornacker a nurse murch ngreat acting talent assembled for this film wa mirrored with kaufman superb direction nmost notable of all is the method kaufman us in order to suggest the passage of time nthe beginning of the film show test pilot living in the middle of desert a virtual unknown far away from strict rule and discipline neverything seems natural yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yard away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world nin that setting it quite normal for important technical problem to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilot not to report their rib being broken before most important flight nbut the time are changing ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war and natural pilot like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined conventional pilot ntheir entire life become focus of medium frenzy and their job is subjected to strict rule meticulous plan and they must fight the bureaucrat publicity seeking politician and uncaring scientist like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun played by scott beach only to preserve their most basic human dignity nthis contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence while yeager conduct his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity mercury astronaut receive fame and fortune although some of them even before going in the space nthose contrast and similar effect are achieved with kaufman superb use of poetic movie language nediting is great and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scene like the funeral in the desert or astronaut in their suit walking in slow motion the same image would be copied in many latter film nalthough kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military which provided authentic location and period equipment he still had to use special effect in order to simulate space flight nthose effect are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space nanother fine contribution of this film is oscar awarded musical score by bill conti still tremble from excitement every time hear it nit is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy nsome of the song used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period nthis film is great and it cult status is well deserved but there are some minor flaw nsome of the mercury astronaut aren fleshed out enough although being played by fine actor like lance henriksen nfilm also lack proper closure non the other hand most logical conclusion of the film landing on the moon would require this film to be more than six hour long nalso some critic were prone to attack this film a too amerocentric and hard on russian who were portrayed a evil monster just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan america nin some of contemporary interview kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film a authentic a possible and in order to do that he portrayed russian not a they were in real life but a they were perceived by american in early 1960s ntime ha passed now we don see astronaut a hero nin this age of widespread satellite communication and routine space mission those men and woman in space suit are seen a mere maintenance worker nfew young boy want to be astronaut when they grow up nbut this film sentimental reminder of the time when future began perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow mercury astronaut footstep seek new frontier in the sky nand even if they decide to stay on earth they could still appreciate the right stuff a an extraordinary piece of cinema',\n",

personality nit exactly the sort of thing the brother relish poking fun at something serious in this case mental illness throwing all care to the wind to get laugh njim carrey signed on too neven better nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaint against the brother new film before it opening claiming it wa misrepresenting the condition of split personality labeling it incorrectly a schizophrenia and so forth nsuch protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would of course only add more fuel to the farrelly brother fire proving that some people just couldn take joke and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewer to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy nyes it all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie isn funny nit not for lack of trying nthe farrellys utilize in me myself irene their most high concept premise ever carrey play charlie baileygaites man who after being dumped by his wife for midget limo driver decides to bury all his aggressive feeling deep down inside and never release them nthis of course mean all his neighbor exploit his entirely too forgiving nature making his job a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult nsoon enough charlie repressed aggression manifest itself into second independent personality named hank deep voiced boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive action his predecessor had been unable to muster nthis guy isn above crashing car through the wall of the barber shop in which he been insulted or holding little girl head underwater because she refused to stop jump roping in the street nthen thing start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the film run off it track nsome have suggested that this isn a problem because the farrelly brother brand of humor doesn require plot to work nthey re wrong of course plot wa greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort 1996 there something about mary 1999 outside providence wa technically an earlier project nthe brother earlier film wasn funny merely because it contained outrageous gag despite what some newsmagazine article would have you believe but rather because it most outrageous gag were entirely unexpected nin mary the farrellys managed several time to pull off neat sleight of hand trick they have you thinking the story wa going one way then reveal it real direction in delightfully surprising fashion me myself irene by contrast seems to have been made by folk who looked at mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all of the subtle machination that really made it work nhaving been produced by the same guy who made mary irene seems like an even bigger disappointment nthe brother pile on the offensive humor taking shot at race midget albino mental illness and all manner of bathroom joke nbut they haven come up with way to make any of it fresh most of me myself irene come off a rote by the number adolescent comedy nthe plot with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene water renee zellweger who in more trouble than anyone know back to new york ha an ending that entirely predictable from the get go think charlie and irene will fall in love nyeah me too nthe farrellys then introduce score of different character and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven already expected them to do no matter how outrageous their action might be ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing this stuff is almost entirely soft tossed presenting an obvious problem when gross out humor loses it shock value it no longer funny merely gross nthe joke that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness run dry ntake for example the subplot involving charlie three black son anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon nthe incongruity of it all is funny for while with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too pleasant smile on his face nbut by the end of the film they re still doing the same schitck it hasn been elevated to another funnier level and it hasn been dropped either nthat too bad because it cease to be amusing about halfway through me myself irene reek of wasted opportunity nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie new personality and on how charlie deal with the consequence of hank action nthis doesn really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie condition early on so they don have any opportunity to be surprised by it nthe film throw what look like patented farrelly curve in scene towards the midway point involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called appropriately whitey but the script doesn go anywhere with it instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax njim carrey is gifted comedian both physically and vocally but he left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in manner similar to steve martin in all of me nit a great showcase of flexibility and split second role shifting but none of it is terribly funny ncarrey doesn pull any stunt we don expect him to pull and the farrellys script doesn give him anything else to pull the situation in which he must perform the role shifting aren set up in any meaningful way nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actor fare no better nzellweger irene is not strong female lead mary in mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she wa also intelligent and strong willed nirene is nothing in particular a the film never make clear whether she ditzy clever or neither na such she give u nothing to latch onto a the only sane person in the film nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note a corrupt fbi agent and his character is entirely too straight laced for movie like this nhe like the others doe absolutely nothing unexpected nafter viewing the shapeless mess that me myself irene eventually dissolved into wa stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audience get wise to it and stop being shocked nbut don believe it good filmmaker find way of surprising their audience even after people have grown attuned to their style nif the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmaker and still think they are they ll rebound just fine neven after that happens though ll still consider me

       " 'rented brokedown palace last night blind having heard nothing about it beforehand and enjoyed it immensely despite some flaw nfor anyone wishing to have the same experience would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in it entirety nthat is no easy task nsuperficially it bear an unfortunate and not necessarily unintended resemblance to several other movie notably return to paradise and midnight express na result nearly every review of brokedown palace subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparison nthe consequence wa nearly universal condemnation which is shame a this is fine film nfor those who have yet to view the movie let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system a wa midnight express nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that wa the heart of return to paradise nin my view if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad acclaimed novel lord jim nproblematically the basic storyline seems more than familiar two american teenage girl on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their life in thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set up involving suave con man shadowy criminal conspiracy and corrupt third world justice system nthe girl are alice claire dane and darlene kate beckinsale nthey re life long buddy who planned high school graduation trip to hawaii and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parent nonce there they find 6 hotel and go sight seeing which includes sneaking into luxury hotel to sip expensive drink poolside nthey get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them but they are saved from hotel security by charming friendly australian nick daniel lapaine who take care of the bill with more polished execution of the girl scam nhe then proceeds to separate the girl and make smooth move first toward alice then toward darlene nby now alarm bell are going off among viewer nthe ever present nick is too slick and his story don add up to u the girl of course are too naive to notice nlong before it happens we re anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting duck at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag literally containing heroin njust a predictably the thai police and court do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourist are prison bound for long stretch nleft unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girl wa willing accomplice nfor those in need of ready answer might suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl fleabag hotel na one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed the girl and their family turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer fixer yankee hank bill pullam and his thai born partner wife na recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality a expressed in one of the film tag line who do you trust and hank is no exception although seasoned movie goer and those familiar with pullman oeuvre will find few surprise nmuch of the remainder of the movie is smorgasbord of intriguing theme incompletely explored in short hand fashion nlou diamond phillips for instance play delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank withholds vital information at crucial moment ni he part of wider conspiracy nwith an inherently powerful if somewhat tired premise the film offer by part riveting courtroom drama prison story and potential character study of american teen their relationship and what constitutes friendship between them nthe result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful with the girl interaction hank investigation and the various trial and hearing offering hope for their release delivering tension a doe the foredoomed possibility of their escape nif brokedown palace ha major flaw it is it creator tendency like time constrained tourist to take frequent side trip down fascinating alley only to reverse direction half way down and return to the story main avenue nand if that were all there wa to brokedown palace it wouldn be very good movie nbut believe the writer and director were after bigger game and in this they succeeded nfor the main theme of the movie like the proffered name of it location is freedom in all it permutation nultimately the other sub theme may be considered window dressing nyoung and pretty alice dane is an old soul wild streetwise teenager with thirst for freedom and adventure npresented a perfect blend of yin and yang dark and light is her cautious best friend darlene beckinsale nclear eyed and straightforward alice is more complex than her friend nshe come from poorer background ha reputation for getting into trouble and ha lost the trust of everyone including her own father nwhereas darlene life is on track aimed at college marriage kid career suburban home middle age and fulfillment alice is uncertain unfocused and yearning none poignant scene in the film show darlene shouting across an open moat to visitor friend and relative from home whose life continue while hers is in limbo ntellingly alice is present but not included njust a revealing of their different personality when alice and dar first come to thailand the openness and delight on alice face doesn read a simple naivet the way she stand up and stretch a she and her friend ride along in small boat reaching toward the sun she really is drinking in what she belief to be freedom while dar remains seated in the shade brokedown palace begin with an admission by alice of her guilt in tape recording sent to hank nhowever unintentional it all alice fault nshe responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parent to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the peril of thailand to try the petty scam which place them in the clutch of the evil nick in case one miss this point in the inevitable confusion of film beginning darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison ndar of course is the willing dupe which in her view confers innocence nnever mind that it wa her coercion of reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate ndar is innocent nit doesn matter nalice is the subject of this movie nshe and her journey toward personal freedom nalong the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girl with their half baked sensibility and materialistic goal nin the end that culture like it representative yankee hank and dar father man who know how to grease the wheel prof a impotent a it government in the face of the girl tragedy nthailand culture contrary to most opinion come off much better by comparison nit amazes me that reviewer argued this point at both extreme ni believe the filmmaker view wa that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior nthe thai with the sole exception of corrupt official and spiteful prison spy were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principle nthe girl were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native born ntheir prison in stark contrast to the probable reality wa no hellhole being relatively clean and sunlit nthe prison authority demanded good hygiene provided medical care when needed and hard manual labor consisted of picking grass nthe thai guard were authoritarian what else but certainly not routinely sadistic na for the thai justice system the reasoning of the thai judge during both an appeal hearing and in the film penultimate scene wa devastating in it logic and morality freedom ha many face and brokedown palace explores many of them nin the extreme we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit nsome settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter nbut freedom seldom come without price nwhich is why the movie other tag line are what is your dream nand how far would you go ni believe could make good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom incarcerated or not by film end is alice nshe find redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility ni think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoner in the final scene visually signal that fact nkate beckinsale character might more properly be likened to the released temple bird referred to twice during the film trained to fly back to it cage na the thai magistrate observed in the film climactic scene the issue wa always one of character and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that freedom is achieved within oneself nif one think back over the movie which character wa transformed by their experience nincreasingly the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutation of kung fu woman female character virtually indistinguishable from male action figure nhere at last is the story of modern heroine nin reading the many user comment wa struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon whether or not person liked the movie almost everyone praised the actor nthink about that nwhen wa the last time you came away from motion picture possibly hating it but raving about all the performance in it ndo yourself favor rent brokedown palace and watch it with open mind nthere more there than meet the eye',\n",

suspense film is because he being played by sidney poitier you know something rotten in the state of denmark nevery year couple film like this are released nyou know the cheap action packed international espionnage film featuring semi promising premise some big name actor usually bruce willis and the hope that some audience member will forget the cold war ended several year ago nthis wa the third one of 97 following the very lackluster the saint which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe and the surprisingly fun the peacemaker featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain the jackal try to mix both element nand you thought the saint wa bad the jackal is loosely very loosely hope based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that ve yet to see the day of the jackal which featured apparently suave hitman called the jackal played by edward fox trying to assasinate charles degaule nwell welcome to the 90 where sorta suave hitman also called the jackal bruce willis trying to kill the head of the fbi or ni he nafter being hired by russian mob lord a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother killed in the opening scene the jackal romp

him nthere are numerous problem with the film and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put finger on nthe film is supposed to be big suspense thriller but save couple moment the film never achieves suspense or even sense of intrigue nsure the big assasination attempt is bit cool looking and even slightly tense but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register nthe film never pick up enough to become thrilling experience or even an entertaining one nit doesn help that the plot is designed to be complex but fall into so many problem like plot hole and unbelievable circumstance nthe script of the jackal is complete mess mostly because it can decide what it want to focus on ni this film about man trying to find redemption by catching nasty killer ni it film about nasty amoral hitman who in everything for the money nor is it combination of both the jackal aim for the latter but never focus in on either character nthe connection between the two feel completely edited so much that in scene when the jackal turn around and notice declan you wonder how he recognized him so fast nthe worst part is the little past they try to give declan most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend isabella mathilda may given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pop up every now and then nthe supporting character are worse nsidney poitier is given completely unplayable role that of man who is just stern sometimes and other time more giving and likable nwhat is poitier doing here nhe one of the best living actor ndoes he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ndiane venora russian character is almost a bad with cigarette perpetually in her mouth and plastered on expressionless facade nit not that anyone bad here it that they have nothing to do nthe plot is joke feeling like it wa pasted together by someone in post production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time nthe jackal himself is not even much of an international villain nthere are several time where he in tight situation and make thing worse for himself the only explanation being that the filmmaker wanted to toss in cheap thrill ntake scene where he being followed by some agent into parking garage he quickly spray his car another color and add solvent that if touched kill the person who touched it ndoesn killing someone attract more attention than it doe distract nand doe he think dying his hair bottle blond make him fit in in public place ngeez ni there anything good here nwell ncouple thing ni did like willis icy expression he may not have been real suave or anything but some of his look are worth chuckle nrichard gere ha couple of good moment making his character a likable a he possibly could have nand couple sequence are kicky in that kind of proposterous completely inane but fun kinda way most notably sequence where he test out new gun on an annoying gun builder jack black and bit where he seduces gay washington man which ha it share of couple good joke most particular kiss by willis nbut none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go they re just little distraction along the way to amuse u mildly then toss u back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is the jackal ndirector michael caton jones who directed the far superior rob roy ha made film that is made very couple month one that is unentertaining unintriguing and pretty much cold but will nevertheless make money because hey the trailer do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro clancy kinda way nevery now and then the filmmaker get it right clear and present danger which wa enormous fun in that smart kinda way

       " 'the most common and in many case the only complaint against francis ford coppola 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia which is presented a an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtue like honour loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler kinder age nmartin scorsese another italoamerican moviemaker confronted that perspective with his own more down to earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean street movie that dealt with lower echelon of organised crime nunfortunately for scorsese his film wa unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola influence on mafia portrayal in the movie nseventeen year later scorsese returned to mean street of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime nthis film wa goodfellas epic black comedy which is today considered a one of the best and most influential film of 1990s ngoodfellas owes some of it initial success and popularity to the fact that it wa based on the true story told in best seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi who would co write the screenplay for the film nthe book a well a the film chronicled thirty year in the life of henry hill played by ray liotta irish italian criminal from new york nat the age of 13 he get recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero played by paul sorvino local mob bos and gradually climb up the ladder starting with small errand nafter couple of year together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito played by joe pesci he join the crew of expert thief led by jimmy conway played by robert de niro nthree of them spend year a best friend and associate gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprise that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robbery in american history nwealth influence and privilege of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen played by lorraine bracco who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelity domestic abuse arrest and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business nbut the perfect world of wiseguys gradually begin to fall apart tommy unpredictable outburst of homicidal violence jimmy reluctance to share his part of the loot with partner and finally henry own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friend ngoodfellas is an excellent example of film that represents work of film genius in his full glory nscorsese managed to create vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradiction that would ripped the film apart in the hand of le talented filmmaker nworld depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating nscorsese spare no effort to show u all the violence hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny nafter being exposed to two and half hour of the film and three decade of criminal history based on some notorious real life event the audience understands why the character chose such dangerous life path trading the superficial and short lasting glamour and prosperity of criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizen nscorsese also manages to break viewer moralistic inhibition by showing truly revolting material scene that depict personal tragedy broken home human depravity violence bloodshed and murder in all their uncompromising reality but in manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience nwith the use of ironic soundtrack manipulative shot character dialogue or narrator commentary goodfellas represents the new standard of black humour that would became very popular few year later during tarantino era neven if we don pay attention to skill with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining we should admit that scorsese display his talent of truly original and creative filmmaker nfirst we might notice unusual structure of the plot relatively minor subplot is used a movie ironic prologue nthen instead of single narrator scorsese switch to the second character a narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards nthis multiple point of view both in term of narration and various subjective shot only lengthens the ironic distance towards character and their situation nsame ironic distance come with extremely effective choice of soundtrack nnostalgia for good old time is illustrated with easy listening 1950s pop song while depression paranoia and bad time find their expression in more neurotic rock song of late 1960s and 1970s nbut the soundtrack is most effective when it is used a ironic comment almost pastoral easy listening tune make strong and very ironic contrast to the scene of violence and bloodshed nhowever thing most associated with this film is couple of continuo shot that feature character moving through large room and interacting with dozen if not hundred of people nsuch scene although they require very great skill and patience during their shooting became very popular among other director in 1990s nfragmentary character of the screenplay which doesn have straight plot and instead base film on series of loosely connected vignette give another interesting opportunity for scorsese nhe us this structure of film to experiment and most successful of such experiment is hilarious day in life segment near the end of the film nanother essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talent nthe most respectable among them is robert de niro but his character who happen to be most quiet and business like member of criminal trio get overshadowed by two of his friend and colleague njoe pesci deserved his oscar for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy and his line including ad libs probably represent the most memorable element of the film nray liotta although equally talented perhaps doesn look a the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film nliotta henry hill look somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low level street thug nliotta on the other hand improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction nlorraine bracco is on the other hand very effective and believable a karen hill wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool a her husband npaul sorvino is also very effective a patriarch mafioso and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low a pestering small time gangster who unknowingly dig his own grave na combination of clever sociological study black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great film could do work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time nbecause of this achievement and also because of the great influence on future filmmaker this cinematic gem deserves it rightful place among the best film of 1990s',\n",

had begun and almost twenty year before the rodney king incident nit violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning wa something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before nin style content and how it wa conceived and produced sweet sweetback wa cinematic revolution whether or not one agrees with it subject matter nvan peebles black american who first gained recognition by writing novel in france built sweet sweetback from the ground up almost entirely by himself nbecause no studio would dare fund such film he wa forced to raise all the money himself nthe movie ended up costing about 500 000 part of which wa put up by none other than bill cosby nvan peebles cut cost by hiring non union labor and taking on most of the film responsibility himself nhe wrote the script scored the music edited and directed the film a well a starred in the central role nhe wa also brilliant entrepreneur who always found way to make an extra buck nfor instance when the mppa slapped the film with dreaded rating van peebles not only threatened to bring lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa but he also developed little marketing scheme he coined the phrase rated by an all white jury which he put on the movie poster to help advertise the film nhe also printed the phrase on tee shirt which he had no problem selling nthe storyline in sweet sweetback is deceptively simple nit take place in los angeles and van peebles star a the title character tough male hustler of few word who grew up in brothel and make money by doing what he doe best having sex none day he agrees to go with couple of amiable white cop down to the station to make it look like they re bringing in suspect on politically charged case involving murder nhowever on the way to the station the cop arrest young black revolutionary named mu mu hubert scale who they proceed to beat viciously nacting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation sweetback fight back and beat the cop to the brink of death nthe rest of the film follows sweetback a he evades the cop on his way to eventual escape in mexico nalthough the repetition of watching sweetback run get little old by the end of the film this plot allows van peebles camera to roam the darker side of a the ghetto alley and back street whorehouse that other film had always overlooked nvan peebles entire point in making the movie wa to secure on celluloid vision of the black experience in america that other filmmaker had ignored nat the beginning of sweet sweetback he offer this epigraph which is traditional prologue used in medieval time when messenger brought bad news sire these line are not an homage to brutality that the artist ha invented but hymn from the mouth of reality nvan peebles wanted to make sure that his vision wa one of reality not of exaggeration nof course with today abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner city life a well a film by spike lee john singleton and the hughes brother sweet sweetback doesn seem all that revolutionary nit is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it wa made nat that time sweet sweetback wa so controversial that only two theater in the entire united state would play it ndistributors were petrified of film that in van peebles word gave the black audience chance to see some of their own fantasy acted out about rising out of the mud and kicking as nof course once it caught on it caught on big sweet sweetback is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era although van peebles disassociates sweetback from other movie like shaft 1972 and the mack 1973 because those were financed by big hollywood studio sweet sweetback is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panther nhowever even if when viewed from an african american perspective sweet sweetback is certainly not without it controversy nwhen it wa first released an article wa published in ebony magazine denouncing the film while at the same time the black panther used an entire newsletter to praise it nthere have been argument that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all beating cop and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of nothers have pointed out that sweetback ha little to say throughout the film he ha no political motivation and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental belief but in personal and selfish motif nstill others point to the clich black potency that stereotype sweetback a being good at nothing but having sex illustrated in scene where he gain the respect of white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm nnevertheless movie like sweet sweetback cannot be made without conflicting point of view nit is revolutionary movie not because it about one man defiance but because it put front and center black issue that had never been dealt with before nuntil that point american cinema wa an almost exclusively white domain and with the exception of sidney poitier all black actor were relegated to specifically black role that were important only in relation to white nthe fact that sweet sweetback wa movie by black about black wa something new in the opening credit van peebles list the starring actor a simply the black community nvan peebles tell an interesting story that go long way toward defining the difference between sweet sweetback and all movie that had come before it nwhen the movie first opened he saw it in theater next to an older woman nnear the end of the film when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert she kept saying to herself oh lord let him die ndon let them kill him nlet him die on his own nit wa so ingrained in her mind that death wa imminent for any african american in movie who rebelled against white authority that she couldn even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape nand of course sweetback doe escape and the screen fill with the message watch out na baad ass nigger is coming back to collect some due nbeyond the political aspect sweet sweetback is an entertaining picture which van peebles always intended it to be nhe squeezed every drop out of his limited budget and produced film that although dated now wa technically fantastic at the time nhe shot in rough documentary like fashion while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him nhe make good use of older technique like split screen freeze frame reversed color scheme and overlapping image nthe only time the film ever look bad is during the night sequence because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment nwatching sweet sweetback more than twenty five year after it initial release one realizes that it still ha bite narguments can be made that race relation in the united state have made quantum leap since the early seventy but there are still problem that are reflected in this film nbut there is more to the film than it racial aspect nthe legacy of sweet sweetback baadasssss song is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african american perspective but more importantly the work of every artist who ha fought to fund and produce that which is important to him',\n",

first week of april in 1999 but so far this year we have been given movie aimed at the 25 and under market almost every single week varsity blue jawbreaker cruel intention simply irresistible the rage carrie 2 and the mod squad ncoming april 9 are two more of this type never been kissed and go and on april 23 we ve got the teen satire election and the teen horror comedy idle hand njeesh nout of all of these move however the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation 10 thing hate about you is this past january mediocre ho hum she all that nalthough similar in plotting ok darn near identical 10 thing hate about you modern day version of shakespeare the taming of the shrew she all that got it inspiration from pygmalion is an infinitely superior film in every department from the smart direction by first time feature director gil junger to the charming and well written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast who give the best group of performance in teen comedy since 1985 the breakfast club nand to top it all off in the inevitable climax set at the prom at least we didn have to once again suffer through goofy inappropriate dance sequence who could forget or want to remember for that matter this ludicrous development in she all that nthe day wide eyed shy new student cameron james joseph gordon levitt start school at seattle based padua high he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore bianca stratford larisa oleynik nalthough he doesn know french he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her but find that her paranoid gynecologist father larry miller won allow her to date until her bitter unconventional older sister kat julia stile senior decides to nkat of course ha sworn off the like of boy but cameron set out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her which is exactly what he find in the form of the rebellious patrick verona heath ledger ncomplicating matter cameron dorky friend michael david krumholtz decides to use wealthy jock joey andrew keegan who also ha his sight set on bianca a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him and then cameron hope to steal bianca away from joey na you can see 10 thing hate about you includes huge number of character some of which haven even mentioned such a kat shakespeare obsessed friend mandella susan may pratt and bianca materialistic comrade chastity gabrielle union nat short but well used running time of 98 minute all of the character are perfectly handled satisfyingly developed and for the most part are not treated a caricature another flaw of she all that where the bad guy and gal ran around constantly saying you re vapor nsince could sympathize with the realistic depiction of the central character and since many of the comedic and dramatic scene were surprisingly effective got completely caught up in all of the relationship and wa thoroughly entertained naside from good screenplay it the performance that can make or break movie and director junger ha really hit the jackpot naside from joseph gordon levitt 3rd rock from the sun who give his strongest performance to date here none of the actor are that well known but it is this aspect that brings particular freshness to the proceeding na the main character of kat julia stile last seen in the miniseries the 60 is marvelous and always believable and certainly ha bright future ahead of her neven though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard edged it wa easy to identify with kat way of thinking she is against the silly tradition of the prom and love reading sylvia plath and completely admired her individuality nno one think could have portrayed her a perfectly a stile doe nheath ledger a the infamous bad boy of the town injects much life into patrick and ha lot of chemistry with stile none other actor of note is larisa oleynik who with the help of screenwriter lutz and smith is able to turn bianca into person with multi dimension even though she is accurately self centered at the on set nin one truthful scene cameron angrily asks her if she ha always been so selfish and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes she ha none off beat element of the film and source of some hearty laugh is the way that the school staff act which is strikingly unformal nallison janney a the guidance counselor m perky who is writing trashy harlequin romance novel is comic dynamite a is daryl chill mitchell a the english teacher who read shakespeare to the class in rap and at one point sends kat to the office because for once she actually think one of his assignment is really good nalthough there are few cheap laugh that are thrown into the film near the beginning most of it actually work especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchange and quirk between the character nin one very funny scene chastity asks know people can be overwhelmed and they can be underwhelmed but can people just be whelmed nat another point bianca and kat father stand out larry miller who is constantly terrified that his daughter are going to get pregnant only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion before she leaf she ha to put on the heavy fat suit he ha so she will get an idea of what it like to be pregnant 10 thing hate about you once and for all prof that there is still life in the teen comedy genre and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the 90 nit also help that the movie ha perfectly assembled soundtrack mixing indie rock with new wave 80 song and with thank goodness no rap nby the film end it actually had me rooting for certain character to get together and wa also quite pleased with how everything wa wrapped up especially in the final scene involving kat and bianca kat and her father and flawlessly acted and moving sequence in which kat get up to read the poem she ha written for her english class this is where the title come from nluckily doubt would be able to find ten thing hate about 10 thing hate about you but the positive aspect of the film far out number ten',\n",
